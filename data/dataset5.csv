Quote,Aura Points
"I don't think it's fatigue. Sometimes, some point of the game, you're going to be fatigued, but I don't think so. I think the rebounds, the second-chance points are a big problem in this series.",
"I mean, it's going to be difficult. Every game is going to be really difficult. It's not over yet, but it's not going to be easy. The Warriors are not going to give you anything easy.",
"I think we're going to learn a lot, and we're still learning, but like we've got to come 100 percent every game.",
"I mean, yeah, it was I think an unbelievable win. Like I say, nobody had us being here in these Conference Finals. But I don't know, man, I think the Warriors are playing incredible. Everybody knows their role. Everybody just stays together.",
"They're a long-built team. They've been together for a long time, and I think they're playing good basketball, so that's what I think is going to be really difficult, and these past three games it's been very difficult.",
"I mean, I got hit a little bit, but that was impressive, I'm not going to lie. I saw the video again, I was like, ooh. That was pretty incredible. I wish I had those bunnies.",
"If I would knew that, I would have executed. I mean, that's a tough question. Like I say, I'm still learning. I think the first two quarters I played very bad. That's on me. But I'm still learning. I think after this season is done, whatever we are, I think we're going to look back and learn a lot of things.",
"Sometimes you feel like you're open and everybody knows you can make a shot, and then just miss. It gets quite a little bit down. But sometimes you've just got to take those shots.",
"It's just a feeling you have in these series. Coming off a win like last game, you know if you can come in and play good basketball and you can essentially put a team away tonight. Now, this team isn't going to quit. They are led by a Hall-of-Fame coach, Hall-of-Fame player, but he's in the Hall of Fame, and a future Hall-of-Fame player in Luka Doncic, so they won't quit.",
But you can instill a lot of doubt with coming out and winning this game and we knew that. We came out with a certain intensely level and focus level that it would take to come on the road and still won. We did that tonight and now the mindset changes to coming out and taking care of our business this next game.,
"So I think the biggest thing I see is maturity, just being ready and knowing what it takes in these situations.",
"I told y'all before, I have never gone into a playoff game feeling like I wasn't prepared or another team was better prepared than us. Our coaching staff continues to do an amazing job, and equally as important, guys are following the game plan.",
"It's going to be a very hard game. No one gets to the Conference Finals and quits, never happens. Up 3-0, up 3-1, whatever. No one ever quits. We're not expecting them to come out and quit. We are expecting them to come out and put their best foot forward. Ultimately if we put our best forward, we give ourselves a chance to win the game.",
"But being one win away from the Finals means absolutely nothing. It just means that. It means you have to win one more game and we have to make sure we come in with an even better focus than we did tonight, which was incredible. Closeout games are always the toughest. We have to come out and win the game, they are not going to give it to us.",
"We knew we had to come out and start this game off right, and kind of seize control, not come out frantic, not come out turning the ball over. Just come out and be solid.",
You appreciate each journey for what that journey brings and the challenges that it brings. But it doesn't feel the same. It feels a lot different.,
"ust feeling the energy. You know, that was the main thing when I seen the rim, that's all I seen. They tried to take it away from me but Steve challenged and we won. Thank him for that.",
"You know, just staying locked in. Staying aggressive. With every game, with every series, it's a different challenge, a different opponent, different type of basketball.",
"You know, just not taking nothing for granted. You know, even though like we're up now, the closeout games are the hardest. These guys are not going to go out without a fight. They are a tough team. So the job is not finished. We've still got to stay locked in and finish the job.",
"It's tough. I think we do a great job, every game, every series is different and the adjustments they make even on the fly, you know, did a lot. So I give credit to them.",
"I try to eat healthy, try to get some sleep, live a good lifestyle and summertime. I condition my body for moments like this.",
And we came back. We just fought our way back. And I think down the stretch we made a lot of turnovers that got them going.,
"My main job is to try to stay focused and, you know, not worry about some of the calls that tend not to go my way.",
"It is tough, you know, because I want to be on the floor to help my teammates, but things happen.",
"It was a great team effort on their part. Everybody came out to play tonight, and that's what they got to go with.",
So we got to do a better job when he catches at the elbow or in the middle of the free-throw line and he backs down and tries to force his way to the hole. We got to do a better job.,
We have. We lost tonight. It is over with. We got to come back ready for Game 6 from the start and protect our own floor.,
We bounce back well. We know what it is going to take. We just got to come out from the beginning.,
"I don't think there is any pressure. We just have to step up our intensity, especially at the beginning of the games.",
We didn't do it tonight and they got off to a big lead. We had to try to fight our way back. And then turnovers was key for us.,
We got to make it a little bit tougher on him and make him take tough shots.,
No. We shouldn't have -- we shouldn't lose any confidence just because of the game tonight.,
"If anything, we should learn, you know, from our mistakes tonight and make sure we don't do the same thing in the next game, and hopefully the outcome of the game will be a little bit different from tonight.",
"Does that mean we can still be as physical as I want to? I don't think so. But I just got to find a way to stay aggressive without fouling. It is tough, but just got to stay aggressive and not foul.",
"Simple. Simple. Two good basketball teams. Just like we went on a nice run, they can do the same thing. So I think that's -- we haven't seen that a lot throughout the season.",
"But now it's here, this is a damn good basketball team over there. When we make runs, you still got to stay composed.",
"You still got to compete. When they score, let's get the ball out, let's go. We got to worry about getting stops when they count, and we did that tonight.",
It was no different. I approached the game the same way I approached each and every game.,
I put a lot of pressure on myself as a basketball player. It was no different tonight. I think the difference was I made shots.,
"Just tried to have some excitement. We had a tough one last night, but just tried to smile and just kind of tried to let it go and move on and worry about the next game.",
"Just go to Dallas and play hard. We've beat them in Dallas before so we know what we have to do, just go out there and play our hearts out.",
"Yeah, like I said, we just came out here, laughed, had fun, put some shots up and had to regroup, and like I said, just get ready for tomorrow's game. We still have a chance.",
"You know, I wasn't scoring the ball well, but just my defense and energy that I could have used, it was tough to watch the guys and you can't do nothing about it. But that's what it is.",
"Just be positive. Like you said, it's not over yet. We have a game on Wednesday, so -- we won in there before, so we've got to try to do it again.",
"They made shots, we didn't. Dirk Nowitzki was great, making threes and contested jump shots, and they played great defense. We lost.",
I didn't know what else to do. I tried to get a shot up. I didn't want to run into their defense and get another turnover.,
I didn't know what else to do. He played good D.,
"This is basketball, man. Our youth has nothing to do with what we were doing on the floor right now. We've showed we can play on this level.",
"They played good defense, man. We missed some shots. Our youth has nothing to do with it.",
It's such a blessing to have great fans because they could have easily just walked out on us.,
They could have -- they stuck with us when we were on our way back. They didn't boo or nothing.,
"Just having fans like that behind us means the world to us, and I feel upset because I think I let them down. I let the city down.",
I just want to come back next game and play even harder. I think I played hard tonight but push it up another level for these fans and try to bring it back here to OKC.,
"And you've got to give them credit, though. They came out to play, and I thought their bench really changed the game today.",
"It just was a tough, tough outing, but you've got to give them credit. They wanted it more, and they came out swinging, and they deserved to win.",
"We said it after Game 1, we've got to be better on both ends, and we weren't. We weren't today, so we didn't deserve to win.",
"Yeah, we've got to take the challenge and be better defensively and from the get-go, and we'll see what happens Saturday.",
"Be sharper, sharper on the defensive end. Rebound the ball is always a key for us, but really the rebounds haven't really hurt us here the first two games.",
"So we've got to go up there in a tough environment and a very loud building and execute and play Mavs basketball and get back to getting some stops like we did in the first two series, and I like our chances.",
"It's about getting the job done on the court. And yeah, obviously they beat good teams to get here. No team gets to the Western Conference by luck.",
"Yeah, they've got athletes on the perimeter, so obviously they belong here. And now they've got all the momentum, so we've got to snatch it.",
"Yeah, that was very poor execution, you know, defensively on our part. Just having our bigs back that far",
"We've got to bring our guys up and run them off the line, and tonight, we were, you know, they were setting solid screens and coming off shooting practice shots. You know, that's the last thing we need if we want to have any chance to beat this team.",
"It's tough, but once we lace our shoes up and put our uniforms on, it's fair and square. You have to go out there and handle your business.",
"I thought our minds were right. We came in the game ready. But they are a team, they go on runs and they make shots, and the game can get away from you.",
"Like I said, we turn the ball over as much as we did, as much as I did, with how much I had the ball in my hands, you know, not valuing it enough, it's going to hurt you.",
"Physically I feel pretty good. This year more than any other, I feel strong. I feel healthy.",
"You know, I've been training nonstop in the weight room and on the court just keeping my body strong. I feel as good as I've felt to this point in my career.",
"Play hard, man. That's the biggest thing. Go out there, play hard, have fun, try to execute the game plan, and that should be enough.",
"I understand who he is as a person to the core, so it's an unfortunate situation and injury to have to fight through, but he's a strong person, and understanding what's at stake, we're in the Playoffs right now, so there's no excuses and there's no way I feel like he can sit out of a game or anything of that nature.",
"We had looks, but we didn't knock them down, and then defensively not getting everything back in transition resulted in a couple easy baskets for them.",
"To shoot a three and one, get a tech, I mean, it's tough. But I gotta be smarter because that didn't do nothing but hurt our team.",
"We've got to defend better. Me, I missed three free throws. And techs, I get that tech, the first one.",
"So guys, you know, pros, they're going to get their rest, do whatever they have to do and whenever it's time to play, everybody going to hoop.",
"A lot of things need to be improved. We can do better on our switches, rebounding, too. We definitely have to rebound better. And we gotta execute and understand that they got shooters, so we gotta try to force the other guys to shoot more shots.",
"I just want to win. I don't care how I look, to tell you the truth, honestly.",
"I mean, they got 104 and we ain't got 105, so that's the problem. That's the name of the game is winning. We have to try to figure it out.",
"It's on all of us. They came out, they punched us in the face to start the game and I think we showed it at spots tonight and certain times, but they're not going to go away easily, so we have to be locked in from beginning to end.",
"I think we'll be ready to go for Game 6. That's a tough loss for us at home, with a chance to clinch to go to the NBA Finals, so we're going to be ready.",
"I mean you can blame it on everybody, a lot of straight lines drives and no help at the same time. So this is a five-man defense, it's been that way the whole season and we have to be better.",
"Yeah, just we're going to be ready. We're going to look at the film of the game and make the adjustments that are necessary. But still having fun with it.",
"The process of this and the journey of it is second to none. I said it after we lost the first one, obviously didn't want to lose any games, but coming back into the film session, getting together as a team and talking everything out, that's part of it too.",
"So once you start enjoying that and having fun with that, then good things happen for our team and we have responded well all season.",
"Honestly it's communication. We all have the same goal in this locker room, that's to win basketball games. So when we don't do that we look at what we did wrong, or when we win basketball games we do the same thing.",
"We don't want to spend the whole game fighting uphill, so just come out with a sense of urgency and be ready to go.",
"This team is just made up of toughness, all across the roster. We're going to give it everything we got and we'll live with the results.",
I'm not sure. I think we do just that. We thrive in this moment. We come together even more so in these moments.,
"I do. And it's the honest truth. It's a fact. But I can't worry about that. It comes with the job, I guess. But it is what it is. I still try to go and dominate, whether I'm shooting the ball well or not shooting the ball well.",
What I can do is do everything else. And so it is what it is. They can judge me on what they want to.,
That part don't matter to me. I'm going to go out there and hoop and give it everything I got.,
"Yeah, it was tough, losing another player, another starter for us. Another big body for us that we need. It was tough. Big loss.",
"Keep saying it, Reg is one of the most positive people. He just keeps everything light. And that's what you need in these moments.",
"But I thought situations like that, you rally together and you just find a way.",
"It's just been tough. It's been a process. I hear LeBron say he's not 100 percent and won't ever be 100 percent again. I thought about it, like, man, that was stripped from me as well.",
"You just keep it moving. But it is tough, going through these injuries, rehabbing, finding a way to be yourself again.",
"But again, it's part of this game and you have to take it. You have to roll with it and you have to be able to adapt.",
"I think the good thing about it, you just learn on the fly. You learn how to adapt to stuff, knowing what you can and cannot do.",
And then you just figure out new ways to do things. I think that's what I've been able to do this year.,
I think that comes down to the mental part because athleticism goes and you pick up tricks on kind of how to do these things you used to be able to do again.,
"Yeah, you never can predict how the game is going to go. But I thought the energy, the mood, was that we were going to come out and if they were going to finish this series off, they were going to have to work for it.",
"That was just the mentality we came into this with. We weren't going to back down. We weren't going to just throw in the towel. The fact of the matter is, they got to beat us.",
"It's one game for us, and it's one game for them. One game they beat us, we're out. One game, continue our season. So we just have that mentality to start the game off.",
"Yeah, we always want to be the initiator of the game and start it off the right way and put pressure on the paint. We put pressure on the rim like that, it opens up other opportunities for people. Everybody on the floor can shoot and can space, so we know when we get downhill that we can make something happen for the team, whether it's score the ball or swing it to the opposite side and get an open shot.",
"Just what you said, just asserting ourselves into the game early. I think the games that we have struggled this year, we were fighting uphill the whole game and starting off down 15, 20 points. But I think when we come out with that pace and that energy, how it should be for a Finals game, we're going to leave ourselves in pretty good shape.",
"It gives you all the confidence in the world. Like I said, we hang our hat on the defensive end, and anything that we're getting offensively is a plus. That's how we try to look at things on this team. So just guarding, and when we can give it to Chris like that and let him isolate any team that is trying to switch 1 through 5, we're in good shape",
"Yeah, he had the toughest assignment tonight in guarding Khris, especially the way Khris had it rolling. But we have been stressing to him all the time, just make it hard on him. He's going to make tough shots, but just always be in the right place. And when's out in transition playing with his length and his speed, he's a tough cover. So if guys want to sleep on him, or whatever you want to call it, he can make you pay. Teams are going to understand that's not the guy to leave open or that's not the guy to leave in transition, because he will make you pay.",
"I just get really excited. That's pretty much it. Us as a team and trusting everybody in this locker room, from coaching staff to training staff all the way down to the players, it's kind of hard to get butterflies because you understand your brother has your back. It takes a lot of pressure off you when you know, good or bad, that you're going to be in the game and you're going to be competing to win. So for me that relieves a lot. I'm sure all the other guys feel that, that you're not pressured to go out there and play a perfect game. You can go out there and play your game, whether you're making or missing shots -- I keep saying it, we're going to be on the other end defending.",
"Chris Paul, he's been a bucket, man. I mean, he obviously, gets his team involved. He's the greatest leader to play this game. But he's been a bucket for a very long time. And my six years of playing against him, or five years of playing against him, you understand that. There's no scouting report that says Chris Paul can't get a bucket.",
"Just the leadership. You understand he's been there before. Our whole team understands he was just there last year, so we bank on him for that grittiness, that toughness. I think a big part of the game was him taking the charge on Giannis down there underneath, just making Giannis think that you just can't go through him every time, because he's a strong base. His shot didn't fall tonight, but as history speaks, we know it will and it can. But he impacts the game in so many different other ways, and whether he's making a shot, whether he's playing good defense, he's always communicating with our team and talking to guys and giving any type of pointers and being honest with them. I always talk about honesty with our team and when somebody's slacking just letting them know. And even if it's aggressive, we have a team that can relay that information and don't take it personal. And Jae is one of them guys that, if you're slipping up, he's going to get on you.",
"Anybody that counted Chris Paul out, I mean we just went down his track record of he's walking in the Hall of Fame first ballot. So you can't ever count any guy out that has done the things that he's done on the court. So if I hear things like that, which I did, I take it as complete nonsense. If he doesn't play another game for us, you can still pay him his contract. His effect is that big, you know what I'm saying? So he moves this team, he leads this team daily. Just having him in the locker room, I'm not even talking about anything he does on the court, he takes the team to that next level.",
"I'm locking that up. That has nothing to do with me. I'm locking C up. I tell him all the time. No, it's tough, it's tough. He's a tough guard. He's one of those guys that you take one thing away, he does the other. It might sound simple, but he just takes what the defense gives him. The ability to shoot the ball and score the ball from any spot on the court just makes you really tough to guard.",
"Just know he's ready. He prepares his whole life for this moment, and it shows out there on the court. Puts in a lot of hard work and sacrifice and takes care of his body. You know he really wants to be here.",
"So just happy to see him go out there, but this is what we -- CP3, man. We know he can do this every game. Happy he did it in Game 1 and helped us get this win. We're going to need him for the next one.",
"Just locking in defensively, getting stops. We all are unselfish and we play fast, so once we get the stop, we just run out and I know for sure if I'm out, they're going to find me. I just start running, even if I'm tired.",
"Just a team effort, getting stops and getting out.",
"Amazing. It just opens up everything, I think. Just for other guys out there, we're spacing and stuff. It opens it up for us to get opportunities. If they start helping toward Book and CP, and then we get shots.",
"For us, just having that mindset to stay ready and be ready at all times because C and Book, they'll find you. That's a great thing about them is that they could go score whenever they want, but they know that they can read defenses and if they're overhelping, they're going to get us looks.",
"No, it's different. It's the NBA Finals. It's a lot different. But I was talking about it earlier today, I think the only thing that I was really ready for was the media. I think being in a Final Four, that media thing is crazy. It's just a lot harder than being on the court.",
"So I think I was trained. Coach (Jay) Wright got us trained, especially going there a couple times helps. Doing that and now going to this media, it makes it way easier for me.",
" Just being aggressive. The Clippers' defense as well, they did a great job limiting everybody else and kind of making us play one-on-one.",
"It just shows that we're just together. I think that's the biggest thing. Jae's the only one, but just together as a team. We're all going to go through it. Win together, lose together, we're all going to be together. I think just us being so close and knowing that obviously this is our first time, but nothing changes on the court. Still the same basketball. Still the same rules, same court, same rims. There's no difference. It's just at the highest stage and, like people say, a little bit more pressure. It's higher stakes. Everybody wants to win.",
So just being together and knowing that it's still basketball at the end of the day.,
"No, it's just every day. We preach it every day. It's never just, okay, let's be together. It's known that we're together and we show it. We don't fake it. We don't try to be together. It's just natural every time we see each other. We're a family. I love these guys. We're just happy we won today. Got to keep getting better and get ready for Game 2.",
