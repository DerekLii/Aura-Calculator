Quote,Aura Points
"I don't think it's fatigue. Sometimes, some point of the game, you're going to be fatigued, but I don't think so. I think the rebounds, the second-chance points are a big problem in this series.",
"I mean, it's going to be difficult. Every game is going to be really difficult. It's not over yet, but it's not going to be easy. The Warriors are not going to give you anything easy.",
"I think we're going to learn a lot, and we're still learning, but like we've got to come 100 percent every game.",
"I mean, yeah, it was I think an unbelievable win. Like I say, nobody had us being here in these Conference Finals. But I don't know, man, I think the Warriors are playing incredible. Everybody knows their role. Everybody just stays together.",
"They're a long-built team. They've been together for a long time, and I think they're playing good basketball, so that's what I think is going to be really difficult, and these past three games it's been very difficult.",
"I mean, I got hit a little bit, but that was impressive, I'm not going to lie. I saw the video again, I was like, ooh. That was pretty incredible. I wish I had those bunnies.",
"If I would knew that, I would have executed. I mean, that's a tough question. Like I say, I'm still learning. I think the first two quarters I played very bad. That's on me. But I'm still learning. I think after this season is done, whatever we are, I think we're going to look back and learn a lot of things.",
"Sometimes you feel like you're open and everybody knows you can make a shot, and then just miss. It gets quite a little bit down. But sometimes you've just got to take those shots.",
"It's just a feeling you have in these series. Coming off a win like last game, you know if you can come in and play good basketball and you can essentially put a team away tonight. Now, this team isn't going to quit. They are led by a Hall-of-Fame coach, Hall-of-Fame player, but he's in the Hall of Fame, and a future Hall-of-Fame player in Luka Doncic, so they won't quit.",
But you can instill a lot of doubt with coming out and winning this game and we knew that. We came out with a certain intensely level and focus level that it would take to come on the road and still won. We did that tonight and now the mindset changes to coming out and taking care of our business this next game.,
"So I think the biggest thing I see is maturity, just being ready and knowing what it takes in these situations.",
"I told y'all before, I have never gone into a playoff game feeling like I wasn't prepared or another team was better prepared than us. Our coaching staff continues to do an amazing job, and equally as important, guys are following the game plan.",
"It's going to be a very hard game. No one gets to the Conference Finals and quits, never happens. Up 3-0, up 3-1, whatever. No one ever quits. We're not expecting them to come out and quit. We are expecting them to come out and put their best foot forward. Ultimately if we put our best forward, we give ourselves a chance to win the game.",
"But being one win away from the Finals means absolutely nothing. It just means that. It means you have to win one more game and we have to make sure we come in with an even better focus than we did tonight, which was incredible. Closeout games are always the toughest. We have to come out and win the game, they are not going to give it to us.",
"We knew we had to come out and start this game off right, and kind of seize control, not come out frantic, not come out turning the ball over. Just come out and be solid.",
You appreciate each journey for what that journey brings and the challenges that it brings. But it doesn't feel the same. It feels a lot different.,
"ust feeling the energy. You know, that was the main thing when I seen the rim, that's all I seen. They tried to take it away from me but Steve challenged and we won. Thank him for that.",
"You know, just staying locked in. Staying aggressive. With every game, with every series, it's a different challenge, a different opponent, different type of basketball.",
"You know, just not taking nothing for granted. You know, even though like we're up now, the closeout games are the hardest. These guys are not going to go out without a fight. They are a tough team. So the job is not finished. We've still got to stay locked in and finish the job.",
"It's tough. I think we do a great job, every game, every series is different and the adjustments they make even on the fly, you know, did a lot. So I give credit to them.",
"I try to eat healthy, try to get some sleep, live a good lifestyle and summertime. I condition my body for moments like this.",
