Quote,Aura Points
"Has not changed. My enthusiasm about being here post-career, bringing a team here has not changed. The fans are amazing here. They have everything already: WNBA team, they have a baseball team coming in soon, NFL team, hockey team, F1 was just here over the Thanksgiving week. Everything is here. This is a place that loves great attractions and I think the NBA will be another great addition to this city.",
"I think that's thinking too far down the road. We want to put it in perspective that it's still December. We like where we are right now but we want to continue to work our habits, continue to get healthy as well.
But I think right now where we are in December, I would take it. I would take it. But I'm definitely not looking to May and June. That's too far. There's too many steps that need to be taken still in order for our team to be who we want to be once the postseason starts.",
"Everything, especially at the later stage of my career, to be able to get a young, hungry alpha male to go out there and just do the things that he does. It's definitely given me an opportunity to be able to not only watch as he's continued to grow, but also be able to try to inspire him as well as he continue to grow in his career and vice versa.",
"Just growth. I think every moment we grew. The In-Season Tournament, 7-0, it's been high-intensity games and we've just grown. I feel like guys have felt a lot more comfortable in their roles. We've had a pretty good understanding of rotations. You know who you're going to be playing with and you know what you guys want to do out on the floor.",
"I mean, it don't really mean much. I just try to do everything I can to win a basketball game. Obviously, my teammates put me in a great position to be successful. Obviously, this is special for us, just winning the inaugural In-Season Tournament. But we want to also win the same thing in June.",
"Means a lot. What he did tonight, but what he's been doing this entire season has been unbelievable. He actually takes a lot of pressure off us, too. We draw so much attention and he's able to go one-on-one or playmake for himself or for the other guys.",
"Obviously means a lot because it helped the team win. But any time I step on the floor, I know I'm the anchor of the defense, giving guys the freedom to press up and get some ball pressure, and if they get beat, I'm there at the rim to alter the shot or block it.",
"But that's my job. I'm constantly talking with the guys. Especially me and Bron have great chemistry as far as our defensive schemes and what we like to do, the four and the five. Overall, I think we've been locked in defensively. Obviously it helps getting Vando back and Cam and Rui. We're able to do a lot more things defensively. But it's my job to be the anchor and lead the team on the defensive end.",
"We've been doing it together for a long time, five years now, and we just figure it out. We know each other's tendencies, what we like to do. Obviously in crunch time, we get to our infamous pick-and-roll and it's tough to stop.",
"We feed off one another. Thursday, LeBron had it going. Tonight, it was me, and he still did his thing.",
"But it wasn't just us two. Obviously the whole team, Austin, D-Lo, everybody contributed tonight. Cam with his defense. T.P. It was a great team win tonight.",
"Yeah, we're sick, frustrated. We just got outplayed tonight from the start of the game to the end of the game. Just didn't do the job on loose balls, didn't rebound, didn't get enough stops when needed. They just outplayed us, and it's frustrating.",
"We've got to take that one on the chin, and we've got a flight tomorrow and we play Detroit on Monday. I know it has that NCAA Tournament feel, championship feel, but we play in a couple days, so it's all part of the season.",
"I just think if you let that -- we've done some great things to get here, competed against some really good teams and battled, and you can't let that happen for no reason. If you allow this loss to roll over and we've got a four-game road trip coming up here, you've got to take care of business and handle it the right way and celebrate the successes of it.",
"Yeah, I think just congratulating the team. They did a great job. Everybody competed. I think at the end of the day it was just one great -- I'm just talking to a great and congratulating him on the win and moving on.",
"I think they've said these games have had a playoff-type feel, so playing against Boston, playing against Milwaukee, playing against the Lakers, seeing how coverages are, seeing how teams are going to guard me. I think tonight was interesting. There was a lot of putting two on the ball and making me make reads out of it.",
"Every team doesn't have Anthony Davis and a bunch of 6-8, 6-9 wings, so there's that, as well. Just understanding how different looks are going to come. This doesn't have a regular season feel at all. I'm used to playing LeBron whatever he plays, 30, 35 minutes. It felt like him and AD never came off the floor. It was like a playoff type deal.",
"It's a good question. I don't think that that really happens anymore. I think last year we snuck up on teams. Teams didn't really know what to expect.",
"I think teams know what to expect at this point. Obviously, people didn't expect us to get to here, to the championship game, but I think teams are prepared for us.",
"Yeah, that's a great question. I think that that's what -- like you said, it's a star-driven league in a world that's so me, me, me. I just want the focus to be on our group and our team and what we do.",
"I think that's what's been good about us succeeding. Of course, there's going to be -- people have said MVP, All-NBA, All-Star, whatever if that happens, but at the end of the day I just want to play basketball, and I want to succeed as a team, and I know individual success comes with that",
"Yeah, I think just paying attention to what has worked for us and understanding that we can beat anybody. We've proven that. I think just ultimately, it's same as always. You go back, watch the film on this game, see what we can learn from that, and just keep growing.",
"Our offense, we get time to grow in that, as well. That's the beautiful thing about the NBA and basketball in general.",
"Yeah, ultimately it's trust your eyes, trust what's in front of you. I think people see how we play and how fun it looks and think I'm a player that people want to play with.",
"If guys want to come play with Indy, I'm going to be here. I'm waiting whenever guys want to come. But we've got a great group of guys in our locker room as we speak and I'm focused on that right now.",
"That's a fair question. Me and Brock went to school together. Came into school together. We both started both as freshmen. That's somebody I can really call a friend. To see what he's doing and succeeding the way he is, that's really cool to see, especially being from Iowa State where it's not a school that's expected to have this much success at the professional level in any sport",
Obviously we see the success with Summer League and things of that nature and the Aces as well. It will be fun.,
"That was cool. Just seeing him succeed and seeing him doing what he's doing, it means a lot to me and it means a lot to Iowa State fans in general to see us guys doing that. Hopefully it's a good recruiting tool for the Cyclones moving forward.",
"It's cool to see my brother do well. And yeah, like you said, from the moment that he started out, I was showing him nothing but love. It was cool, in college, Coach [Matt] Campbell, the football coach, we used to have leadership meetings, me, Brock and Coach Campbell, and we had a book we'd read and we used to talk about different stuff.",
"It's the NBA, there's a lot of moving parts, but I'm focused on the guys in our locker room right now and continuing on with the season.",
"So at the end of the day, I can help and I talk to guys and everybody talked about USA and the constant recruiting that goes within USA and stuff like that, but my job is just to play basketball.",
"It's got to be what's in front us. We understand that. So, this game we can frustrated by; watch the film tomorrow; but we play the Pistons on Monday, so we've got to move on and just take it one day at a time.",
"I think just keep growing, keep learning, and not viewing the season, and I think it's easy for a young team to look -- especially now that we've tasted some success to look so far ahead and be like, oh, by the time we get to February, by the time we get to the Playoffs. It can't be that.",
"That's the great thing about playing 82 games. We play again on Monday. I know everybody thinks they're like a genius to say that we need to play more defense or whatever the case may be, but that's the great thing about 82 games, is we get time to grow in that.",
"I think as a person who loves the sport, I think everybody can appreciate that.",
"I think that's been something that I've really enjoyed about our run right now is that it's forced the media to talk about what's in front of them, which is basketball.",
I think that it's kind of tiring -- I think the In-Season Tournament has been really good because -- and us having success has been good because it's forced the media to talk about basketball and talk about what's in front of you and not have to talk about legacies and all the BS that comes with it and actually talk about basketball.,
"I think teams know what to expect when we come in the gym, and I don't think anybody is taking us lightly.",
"I think now when you play the Pacers you know what to expect. You know we're going to run. You'd better have your track shoes ready, be ready to run with us, and we're going to score and the game is going to be up-and-down.",
"And we've beaten Boston, beaten Milwaukee. Those are two of the top teams in the east. We play Milwaukee here in a couple days. They're going to be ready for us.",
"Just getting accustomed to that was good for me and makes me want to play some more games that have some meaning to them, so handle the season the right way so I can get to the Playoffs and feel that.",
"I had a couple early turnovers, bad ones, but then after that I don't know what we shot from three, I don't have it in front of me, 10 for 41 or something like that. We missed a lot of good looks, and it happens. It's a make-or-miss league, and for me it's understanding how teams are going to guard me moving forward.",
"I had a couple early turnovers, bad ones, but then after that I don't know what we shot from three, I don't have it in front of me, 10 for 41 or something like that. We missed a lot of good looks, and it happens. It's a make-or-miss league, and for me it's understanding how teams are going to guard me moving forward.",
"It's funny because it's like everybody says this has like the NCAA Tournament feel, but after a game like that you're sitting in the locker room going, most of us ain't graduating, we play on Monday. It's definitely frustrating.",
"It's a step in the right direction, obviously, but even though it's a big performance, it's another game and we've got to continue to get going starting back on Tuesday.",
"He's meant a lot to our organization and to our team. There's nothing that he can't do on the offensive end, and he's locking in defensively. He means a lot to our ballclub, and it just shows every time he steps on the floor.",
"And like AD said, getting Vando back, getting Rui back has helped our frontcourt, our size, and getting Cam back has helped us a lot. Not too many people talk about it, but one of the biggest shots of the game was they made their run, cut it to three and Cam hits that big-time three in front of our bench to put it up six. We didn't go back after that. Cam has been big-time for us and I'm happy to see him thrive under this role with us because he deserves it, for sure.",
"As of today, I like the way we played in the semifinals on Thursday and then tonight. Our defensive intensity, in order for us to win and win at the highest level, we have to defend. We've been doing that over the last few weeks.",
"I feel like when we are on the floor together and we're healthy, we know when we're capable of doing. We've played too many games together, shared too many moments together, played in too many big moments together to fail each other. It's been everything, like I said, especially at the later stage of my career.",
"I think they started the way I expected them to -- just locked in, locked in on our opponent, locked in on our game plan, leading by example and verbally to our group, reading the defense, just reading the game they're playing. They have done a great job of just being who they are, but at the same time, trying to mold themselves into whatever that series or that team is forcing us to be as a team, as individuals, and I think it's not a surprise to me that they've come out and performed the way they've performed the first few rounds.",
I'm happy for them. I'm not surprised at all. They put a lot of work into it. They're doing exactly what they're supposed to do. We've got to do the same thing again tomorrow.,
"I'm very grateful for the opportunity, but I'm looking for a different outcome than I had last time honestly. That's all fine that I've been here before, but I haven't won anything. So, it really doesn't mean anything to me personally. But I use my last stint as motivation to get back here to have a chance to play for it all again, to work my way to be in this position. Hopefully it's a different result, and that's my motivation in it all.",
"It's great to be here again and be a part of a special team, but I want to get the job done this time.",
"What she's told me is to just enjoy it. It's an opportunity of a lifetime, and really just leave everything out there. Believe in yourself because you're prepared for it. And, most of all, just enjoy it. Everything that comes with it.",
"Yeah, just to continue to be aggressive. No letdowns, because the way Giannis plays there are no letdowns. He's continually going to the basket, being aggressive on both ends of the floor. He brings so much to this team. He does so much for us that I feel like losing that would really be hard for us. So just continuing to be aggressive from minute zero to 48.",
"I'm happy for Torrey. I'm excited to see him. Again, us having conversations during the year, we wanted to get to this place. And he did it -- not with us, but he did it with a different team. Happy for him. He's out there playing and fighting for the same thing we're fighting for, but would love to beat him.",
"I tried to sleep. I tried to sleep and recover. We were literally home for like, I don't know, six hours -- more than six hours. I'm exaggerating, but something like that where we hopped off one flight and hopped on another one. So really just trying to prepare for Game 1.",
"Yeah, he's a legend, and in more than one category. Obviously, basketball-wise, me going to UCLA and me growing up a Laker fan and then me playing for the Bucks, it's actually really, really cool how connected we may be. But I think just what he's done for our community, what he's done for basketball is huge. That's something that I look up to and something that I try to follow suit.",
"Great basketball mind. Great basketball mind, especially when it comes to basketball. But off the court he's a great person. He treated everybody kind of like a son. He was more of a father figure and really cared for each one of his players. I feel like that's what I cherish most about the time there. Yeah, I was hurt, but so many times when I was hurt he could relay messages to me about him being hurt and sharing those moments. So he's been a great person for me and my growth and being a pretty good basketball player.",
"I think we have had a lot of different looks. Miami, a team that plays pretty fast and really relies on threes. They were huge in the first round. And then we had that seven-game series with Brooklyn, which was exhausting. Some of the best scorers in the league on one team and really having to test your individual defense. And then we had Atlanta, where you have one great young star and then you have guys who rebound and go to the rim, a couple other young guys who are going to be great, but really tried their best to go at us. So I think we had a lot of different looks.",
"This team, the Suns, I feel like they're great in transition. They play super fast. Deandre Ayton, Jae Crowder, they go to the boards. And then you got that individual, Chris Paul and Devin Booker. So it's actually prepared us pretty well for this moment.",
"Yeah, they're different players. You just really have to know their tendencies, what they like to do. I think everybody has watched Chris Paul play as a little kid -- not saying he's old, but we have seen him play a lot, and he gets to his mid-range and he's great at his mid-range, especially in the pick-and-roll. Book is great in the iso, going left or right, pull up. He's athletic, so he can get to the basket too. Just attention to details and try to be as solid as possible.",
"I think that comes with chemistry and it comes with trust. I think all of us at some point found the trust in one another, knowing that this guy guarding the ball is going to do his best and going to be as solid as possible. But it takes more than one person to guard somebody. We found that out with Brooklyn. I mean, KD was going off. When you got somebody like Trae Young, who went for 48 the first night and progressively we feel like did a better job every game since, that takes a team effort. It's not just one guy.",
I think it's being able to pay attention to adjustments. Being smart and being able to read the game. I think attention to detail and being able to make the adjustments and then actually go out there and do them is huge for why we have felt like we have gotten better every single game in the series.,
"The first one was the advantages we have? Honestly, I think it's our defense. I feel like defense wins games, and the way that we have been able to play defense has been proven to help us win games. We have played some mucky games and low-scoring games, but our defense came through. And, man, I'm just excited for Game 1. We got to take it a game at a time. It's Game 1 on the road, too, so it's kind of us against the world. To get these four wins, it is going to be difficult. But really excited for it.",
"I think one of the keys is just looking back and reflecting on what we have been through this season, what we have been through in the playoffs and then looking at our goal. Everybody on our team has had the same goal and we're so close to reaching it. I feel like that's enough for us to focus in and try to get these four games.",
"I'm excited to be here. Just enjoying the moment. Not really trying to worry about anything, be too far in the future or anything like that. I just kind of want to soak everything in.",
"If there's a souvenir shop, I'll probably get my wallet and buy something. So, I don't know, maybe that's what the NBA's missing out on, like, merchandise for the actual players. I don't know. That's a new angle.",
"Yeah, I mean, just the way Bobby and P.J. play any game, whether it's a preseason game or a Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals, they're just going to play with so much energy and so much intensity and that is just naturally contagious and everyone feeds off it. People can't help but feed off it. So, it is so big-time for us.",
"Yeah, I mean, he's obviously developed very rapidly and even this season and even in the playoffs, he just continues to get better, and so I know he's going to be a load down there. He's very talented in the post. He can step out and shoot it. He's great in the pick-and-roll, and he crashes the offensive boards hard, just plays hard in general. So, he's definitely going to be a load to guard and it's going to be a fun matchup.",
"Yeah, I mean, you know, we obviously can kind of do both those things. We had film right before we got here. We watched Phoenix, their offense, their defense, everything, and talked about what we were going to do and game plan. So, we're all on the same page there.",
"And then after we go through this, we're going to go on the court and walk through some stuff. So, it's just kind of taking turns, doing certain things at a time, but we obviously have our focus.",
"I think it's just going to be kind of what we have hung our hat on as long as I've been here and that's defense. We got to come out, play defense, respect the Suns, which we definitely do. They're a great team. And we have to just come from the jump, be ready from the jump, and play a full 48 minutes each and every night for seven games.",
"Yeah, I mean, having Vin on the sideline and as a resource for me has just been invaluable. It's, I mean, at first, for me, obviously, just as a basketball fan, I was, like, this is awesome. I got Vin Baker pretty much as my big-man coach. But just getting to know him and becoming great friends, you're almost like family, and I call him my older brother.",
"To have him on the sideline, someone who is done everything in the NBA, been through what we're going through right now, it's great to see, and it was actually really special. We were talking, and I said, you know, he had never been to the Finals before, so he's living through this as we are, too. So, it's just, it's been a special bond that we have created. And he's such a great basketball mind as well. Like I said, just having played on an NBA floor, he sees things sometimes the coaches miss. He knows what it's like, and so it's very special having him on the sideline.",
"Obviously, Giannis attracts a lot of attention. He's a huge part of what we do. But I think, in a way, with or without Giannis, we know we have to just go out there and play Bucks basketball. We're going to have to play great team basketball, rely on each other, play together, and, again, play great defense, play great defense for 48 minutes.",
"On the road to the Finals, for us, we had, I think, different matchups each round. Miami obviously gave us a different look. Brooklyn was different, and Atlanta was different. And I think, honestly, Phoenix will be a different look. So, it's kind of like a, what we have been doing all season long, that's just obviously respecting our opponent, but focusing on ourselves.",
"I don't know if I can speak for everyone, but for me personally, I think I just, there hasn't really been any doubt for me throughout this playoff run, just, whether we were up 2-0 against Miami or down 2-0 against Brooklyn, I think I've had that confidence and -- I'd try to change what I said earlier. I would like to be able to speak for everyone else and saying that we have all had that confidence going through, that we can achieve that goal of winning a championship.",
"Yeah, it's definitely been bizarre. I mean, we were in Chicago maybe, gosh, it might have been a couple weeks before the season ended, and they still didn't have fans in the stands. So, to go from that and to be fortunate enough to be playing in front of 17,000, like you said, that's, I mean, that's every kid's dream to play in the NBA Finals and you want to be able to experience that environment. And that's something Giannis, P.J., Jrue, they have just been saying the whole time, is like, we want to enjoy being on the road, playing against all those fans, going crazy cheering against us. That's all part of that, all part of enjoying being in the situation, so I think we're all very excited for that.",
"It's great. Hopefully I'll have another, better moment in the next couple days or week or two. But it's been a great run so far. It's been a grind, but I think we all love it. We all appreciate it.",
"No, I'm going to ride with them too. I think we're all having each other's back out there. Jrue has been fantastic. Giannis has when he's been out there. Brook, Bobby, Pat. I can go down the line. P.J. Tucker. We all use each other out there. We all need each other out there.",
"Just be the best version of myself I can be, the best player. I think I've put a lot of work in, but every NBA player has. We wouldn't be here -- we wouldn't be professionals if we didn't. To be the best, you have to work like the best. I think we all believe in that.",
"Just tell him to do what's best for himself and his family. Don't rush back in and put yourself at a greater risk for a greater injury. But he's a guy, like you know, he puts in so much time and effort into his body to be the best version of himself also. So, yeah.",
"It's been great. I think the biggest guy that had to adjust the most is Brook. I mean, he's a guy that's 7 feet that sometimes has to switch onto point guards, shooting guards. They try to take advantage of him, but he does a great job of using his size, his length, to contest shots and keep guys in front of him.",
"He's a guy that has a lot of experience in that. In his whole career, he's been a guy that's guarded 1 through 5. So to have him on our team, to give us the confidence to go ahead and throw those different lineups out there and rely on him in a lot of different situations, it's been great.",
"Yeah, just a team that's trying to play unselfish, trying to do it as a committee. When Giannis is out there, a lot of times we can just give him the ball and let him go to work and let him orchestrate a lot of things out there. Without him, we have to do it by committee, moving the ball around, driving it a little bit more, playing just a little bit faster with a little bit of different flow. But I think guys have done a great job of adjusting with him out, with him not out there in two of the most important games of our season.",
"I think it's huge. A lot of coaches' and teams' schemes, they want you to shoot threes and layups. That's what a lot of teams expect you to do. But when you stop sometimes, they just don't expect it. It gives you a clean look. So if you work on it, it almost seems like a layup or a three-point shot for myself.",
"It's cool. Everything is a first for us. Like, this is my first Media Day for something like this. So we're all trying to stay locked in as much as we can, not think about the outside influences of it being the NBA Finals. Just trying to take it one game at a time.",
Just stay the course. Not try to think about too much except for what I need to do on the basketball court. Try to not get rattled when things aren't going my way. Don't get too cocky when things are going my way. Just staying the course and just working for it.,
"Just a guy that hits tough shots, a guy that can score from the three, the mid-range and the paint, a guy that can get to the free throw line. He's a guy that really can score in every single way, which is tough to guard because you don't know when he's going to stop and shoot, when he's going to keep going, when he's going to look to create for others. It's just a great balance he has.",
"I think everything we have been through is just experience. You learn from it. The postseason failures we have had so far, we have found a way to use that as motivation and just use that and let it teach us how to be better, how to be better people, how to be better players.",
"He was a teammate of mine, and not just a teammate. I say this all the time. Willie is like a brother to me, family. His family, his wife, his kids, everything. To have him as a coach, I couldn't imagine going through this season without having Willie here.",
"Willie just gets it. When you play in this league -- I always talk about that Golden State series, Game 7, and his locker was right next to mine. I didn't have a really good first half and he was the one who told me, he said, You got to be more aggressive, C. So he's just always been the guy that I could talk to about anything. He pushes me. I think for him, not only being a good player in his own right, that time he spent with the Warriors and those championship teams, so there's nothing in this league Willie hasn't seen.",
"Man, one thing about our league and its players is everything is always a conversation. There's a ton of guys on the executive committee who are working hard on things right now as we speak -- day in and day out, traveling. I wish you guys knew all the things that are going on. So decisions that are made as far as playing or not playing, players are always involved in it. Injuries are always unfortunate. You hate to have them. But just like when we went to the bubble, everything was discussed as far as the players and the full body of players. Everything that's good for this guy and that guy might not be the same for that guy, but everything has always been a conversation and it's going to continue to be that way. So if people don't like it, then you know everybody has the same opportunity to be a part of all these conversations.",
"It's different. Obviously I haven't practiced here and not at the practice facility, but it's still basketball. I think we're all locked into the goal at hand. And not much, just, I don't know. It's weird no games being on. I usually watch games every day. So that's probably the part that sucks. That's probably the part that sucks the most. But I would rather be playing than not. Other than that, just life.",
"Probably. I don't know. I'm usually on the phone with my kids day in and day out, seeing what they got going on. And just getting ready, practicing, body work, all that different type stuff. So, yeah, I don't even know. I'm focused.",
"Jrue is just the consummate team guy. Plays the game the right way, defends, can score. My family knows, like my parents, I think, know his family very well and stuff. He's just like a good guy, like a great guy. I'm sure they're excited to have him, and that's what's going to make this series so tough.",
"I honestly have no clue how they have started off every series. I think for us it's just about winning games. Winning games and making sure that we have the right approach as a team. But those two guys are two leaders of our team, so obviously we go off them. We feed off them. But we expect that not only at the beginning of a series, but in the middle of a series, at the end of a series -- like, that's why you're in that role.",
"There's no pressure on us at all. We don't look at this as pressure. We've got a golden opportunity to win Game 6 at home on our home floor. It's another game. We don't look at nothing as pressure. These are the conference champions. There's no pressure on us.",
"You're not at practice with me every day. I think for us it's balance in whatever it is. You always got to remember, this is a kid's game that we play, you know what I mean? This is a blessing and an opportunity to play this game. So it's balance. I think our team knows when to lock in and when we got to enjoy the moment and enjoy ourselves.",
"Man, Chris say everything to me. He tells me when I'm playing well, when I'm playing bad. I think that's probably the most exciting part is my kids are of the age that they know everything that's going on. My daughter, who hasn't been a fan of any of my games my whole career, I think that's probably what touched me after the Western Conference Finals, to see her with emotions and see her so excited. So, yeah, just enjoying the process and all the different moments of it. But ready to go.",
"Then just understanding the differences in the three different players. Obviously, Devin Booker being more of a two guard, more of -- obviously, height. He's a little bit taller than the other two. They all have success in different ways on the floor. So, it's really just about understanding what their comfort zone, the one, two, three moves that they're trying to get to most often, trying to make it as tough for those two, three moves as you can, and try to put them in a position to have to go to the counter moves, four, five, whatever it might be, in order to try to put ourselves in the best position to have the most success.",
"I'll tell you, it's just adversity, right? Overcoming adversity. I think, as an athlete in general, as a competitor, you're going to have success and failure, you're going to have to fight adversity at some time. I think not just this year, but going through it and seeing what it takes to win in the regular season versus the playoffs, to see how together you have to be, both on and off the court, to put yourself and your team in the best position to win. Then specifically this year, it hasn't been an easy journey, but we stuck together. We've had open, honest conversations. ",
"We're tried to make sure that we're putting ourselves in a position both on and off the floor to have success, and overcoming adversity throughout the playoffs is inevitable. It's inevitable over the first three rounds. It's going to be inevitable in the Finals.",
"I think some of the similarities are they're really crafty in utilizing their bodies and putting themselves in position to have success both from making shots and also from getting fouled. So, defending without fouling and making sure positionally you're in the right position to not get caught, whether it be via a ball fake, a rip through, an off-balance move, whatever it might be.",
"Remaining together and sticking together, I think has been basically the start of what the culture of the Bucks has been built on, and it's going to be something we have to continue to exude in order to have success the Finals.",
"You can't replace a player the caliber of Giannis -- two-time MVP, the things he does on a nightly basis on both sides of the ball, you can't replace it. But I would say, as a human being, it's even more impressive what he does, and what he's done since he's been injured, continuing to be vocal, if not even more vocal, pulling players aside individually, addressing the team collectively, making sure he's still present and more than a big part of what we're doing has instilled confidence in both individual players as well as the team in general.",
"Obviously, you're talking about a guy that puts up 30 points a night. You're talking about a guy that rebounds the basketball, passes the basketball, defends as well, if not better, than anybody else. You're not going to necessarily replace that with one guy or with one thing.",
"The way we've tried to make sure we've put our best foot forward to have his back while he's out is doing it together. Obviously, Khris, Jrue, Bobby, there's been a bunch of guys that have stepped up in his absence, but it's been a collective group effort. ",
"It's been playing together. It's been sharing the basketball. It's been defending as a team and gang rebounding and doing all of the little things that it takes to win a basketball game so that we can try to put ourselves in this position to get to the Finals to give Giannis some more time to get healthy because, without him, we wouldn't be here. The things that he does off the court -- we all see what he does on the court, but the things he does off the court are, in my opinion, even more impressive.",
"Just everything comes naturally when it comes to leading, I feel like, in an NBA locker room. It just came naturally. Probably my Boston days, I was thrown into that role of being a leader, and my leadership comes natural by just putting in the work and letting my work speak for itself first before I even say a word.",
"I just think it came naturally back in my Boston days, like four or five years into the NBA, and it just comes from the heart. It comes from wanting the best for my teammates and wanting to compete as a team at the highest level and put myself and my teammates in a position to do so. So, that's what it comes from.",
"Yeah, I definitely remember the road trip we took to Milwaukee, and that was a tough road trip for our team, but we prevailed, and we came out with a winning record. I definitely feel like those situations have prepared us for moments in this postseason, no doubt about it.",
"We were playing some tough teams, and obviously Milwaukee was one of the best Eastern Conference teams at the time, and we came out with a win on the road and in a tough environment. Those situations definitely motivated us as a team to come together and definitely know we can play high-level basketball either at home or on the road. So definitely gave us motivation and momentum.",
"Just probably being -- I learned how to work when I was at Marquette. I learned how to put work into the game of basketball. Two years there, I thought I was working up until I got to Marquette, and that's when I really found out how to really work when I step into the gym, learn how to make the days count. I think that rolled over into my professional career, and I know how to put work in when no one's looking, and I think it's definitely beneficial for me to take what I learned in college and implement that into my NBA career, and that's what I did.",
"I just put the work in and locked myself in the gym like I used to back in my college days and let the hard work take care of itself. I think my Marquette days definitely taught me how to work, and it will always be a special place for me. I feel like I'm going home. I feel like I'm playing a series in one of my hometowns. So, it's a great feeling.",
"Well, I miss them. Great people in Milwaukee. I hold great relationships with a few people in Milwaukee to this day. Like I said, it's a special place to me. I did a lot of stuff within the city. I've been to Brewers games. I've been to Bucks games back when I was in college, and I've been to Green Bay Packers games. So, I was a fan by default, and I did my part when I was in the city of Milwaukee of just embracing the love that I was getting throughout the city and that I get every time I touch the court there in Milwaukee as a professional. It's always love.",
"That place will always be special for me and my family, and the relationships that I share with the people still who live there will always be there. So, it was very special to me.",
"Cam, the one thing that sticks out to me now is that he gets it. His whole mentality, his mindset is he gets it. He gets how to be a pro. He understands it now, now that he was in and out and now is back in, he understands what it takes to be a professional athlete, especially an NBA player. He understands to put the work in. He understands all of that stuff that he went through was a test, and he's answered the bell repeatedly up until this point to get to where he is today.",
"It's no coincidence that he's fought back to be an NBA basketball player playing in the Finals. And what he means to our team, he does a great job of, first of all, talking to and having a relationship with Chris, with him being his backup and him trying to have a great career like Chris. He does a great job of just taking in all the stuff that Chris gives him, all the stuff that I give him, all the stuff that Coach Monty gives him and applies it on the court.",
"We do a good job of helping him, but he does a great job of just applying it. That's all him. That's all him putting the work in and wanting the best for himself and wanting best for our team. He's special to our team, and he's a great weapon to have.",
"I think they started the way I expected them to -- just locked in, locked in on our opponent, locked in on our game plan, leading by example and verbally to our group, reading the defense, just reading the game they're playing. They have done a great job of just being who they are, but at the same time, trying to mold themselves into whatever that series or that team is forcing us to be as a team, as individuals, and I think it's not a surprise to me that they've come out and performed the way they've performed the first few rounds.",
