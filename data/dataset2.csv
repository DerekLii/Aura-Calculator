" Has not changed. My enthusiasm about being here post-career, bringing a team here has not changed. The fans are amazing here. They have everything already: WNBA team, they have a baseball team coming in soon, NFL team, hockey team, F1 was just here over the Thanksgiving week. Everything is here. This is a place that loves great attractions and I think the NBA will be another great addition to this city.
Obviously we see the success with Summer League and things of that nature and the Aces as well. It will be fun.",
" I think that's thinking too far down the road. We want to put it in perspective that it's still December. We like where we are right now but we want to continue to work our habits, continue to get healthy as well.
But I think right now where we are in December, I would take it. I would take it. But I'm definitely not looking to May and June. That's too far. There's too many steps that need to be taken still in order for our team to be who we want to be once the postseason starts.
As of today, I like the way we played in the semifinals on Thursday and then tonight. Our defensive intensity, in order for us to win and win at the highest level, we have to defend. We've been doing that over the last few weeks.",
"Everything, especially at the later stage of my career, to be able to get a young, hungry alpha male to go out there and just do the things that he does. It's definitely given me an opportunity to be able to not only watch as he's continued to grow, but also be able to try to inspire him as well as he continue to grow in his career and vice versa.

I feel like when we are on the floor together and we're healthy, we know when we're capable of doing. We've played too many games together, shared too many moments together, played in too many big moments together to fail each other. It's been everything, like I said, especially at the later stage of my career.",
"Just growth. I think every moment we grew. The In-Season Tournament, 7-0, it's been high-intensity games and we've just grown. I feel like guys have felt a lot more comfortable in their roles. We've had a pretty good understanding of rotations. You know who you're going to be playing with and you know what you guys want to do out on the floor.

And like AD said, getting Vando back, getting Rui back has helped our frontcourt, our size, and getting Cam back has helped us a lot. Not too many people talk about it, but one of the biggest shots of the game was they made their run, cut it to three and Cam hits that big-time three in front of our bench to put it up six. We didn't go back after that. Cam has been big-time for us and I'm happy to see him thrive under this role with us because he deserves it, for sure.",
" I mean, it don't really mean much. I just try to do everything I can to win a basketball game. Obviously, my teammates put me in a great position to be successful. Obviously, this is special for us, just winning the inaugural In-Season Tournament. But we want to also win the same thing in June.

It's a step in the right direction, obviously, but even though it's a big performance, it's another game and we've got to continue to get going starting back on Tuesday.",
" Means a lot. What he did tonight, but what he's been doing this entire season has been unbelievable. He actually takes a lot of pressure off us, too. We draw so much attention and he's able to go one-on-one or playmake for himself or for the other guys.

He's meant a lot to our organization and to our team. There's nothing that he can't do on the offensive end, and he's locking in defensively. He means a lot to our ballclub, and it just shows every time he steps on the floor.",
"Obviously means a lot because it helped the team win. But any time I step on the floor, I know I'm the anchor of the defense, giving guys the freedom to press up and get some ball pressure, and if they get beat, I'm there at the rim to alter the shot or block it.

But that's my job. I'm constantly talking with the guys. Especially me and Bron have great chemistry as far as our defensive schemes and what we like to do, the four and the five. Overall, I think we've been locked in defensively. Obviously it helps getting Vando back and Cam and Rui. We're able to do a lot more things defensively. But it's my job to be the anchor and lead the team on the defensive end.",
"We've been doing it together for a long time, five years now, and we just figure it out. We know each other's tendencies, what we like to do. Obviously in crunch time, we get to our infamous pick-and-roll and it's tough to stop.

We feed off one another. Thursday, LeBron had it going. Tonight, it was me, and he still did his thing.

But it wasn't just us two. Obviously the whole team, Austin, D-Lo, everybody contributed tonight. Cam with his defense. T.P. It was a great team win tonight.",
"Yeah, we're sick, frustrated. We just got outplayed tonight from the start of the game to the end of the game. Just didn't do the job on loose balls, didn't rebound, didn't get enough stops when needed. They just outplayed us, and it's frustrating.

It's funny because it's like everybody says this has like the NCAA Tournament feel, but after a game like that you're sitting in the locker room going, most of us ain't graduating, we play on Monday. It's definitely frustrating.",
"We've got to take that one on the chin, and we've got a flight tomorrow and we play Detroit on Monday. I know it has that NCAA Tournament feel, championship feel, but we play in a couple days, so it's all part of the season.",
"I just think if you let that -- we've done some great things to get here, competed against some really good teams and battled, and you can't let that happen for no reason. If you allow this loss to roll over and we've got a four-game road trip coming up here, you've got to take care of business and handle it the right way and celebrate the successes of it.

But at the end of the day, it's just like the regular season. It's Game 22, 23. Got to move on.",
"Yeah, I think just congratulating the team. They did a great job. Everybody competed. I think at the end of the day it was just one great -- I'm just talking to a great and congratulating him on the win and moving on.

I think that he's shown me love constantly since I've came in the NBA, and obviously I have him for the majority of my life. It was great to compete against him and that team, and they're a good team and earned that win.",
"I think they've said these games have had a playoff-type feel, so playing against Boston, playing against Milwaukee, playing against the Lakers, seeing how coverages are, seeing how teams are going to guard me. I think tonight was interesting. There was a lot of putting two on the ball and making me make reads out of it.

I had a couple early turnovers, bad ones, but then after that I don't know what we shot from three, I don't have it in front of me, 10 for 41 or something like that. We missed a lot of good looks, and it happens. It's a make-or-miss league, and for me it's understanding how teams are going to guard me moving forward.",
"Every team doesn't have Anthony Davis and a bunch of 6-8, 6-9 wings, so there's that, as well. Just understanding how different looks are going to come. This doesn't have a regular season feel at all. I'm used to playing LeBron whatever he plays, 30, 35 minutes. It felt like him and AD never came off the floor. It was like a playoff type deal.

Just getting accustomed to that was good for me and makes me want to play some more games that have some meaning to them, so handle the season the right way so I can get to the Playoffs and feel that.",
" It's a good question. I don't think that that really happens anymore. I think last year we snuck up on teams. Teams didn't really know what to expect.

I think now when you play the Pacers you know what to expect. You know we're going to run. You'd better have your track shoes ready, be ready to run with us, and we're going to score and the game is going to be up-and-down.",
"I think teams know what to expect at this point. Obviously, people didn't expect us to get to here, to the championship game, but I think teams are prepared for us.

And we've beaten Boston, beaten Milwaukee. Those are two of the top teams in the east. We play Milwaukee here in a couple days. They're going to be ready for us.

I think teams know what to expect when we come in the gym, and I don't think anybody is taking us lightly.",
" Yeah, that's a great question. I think that that's what -- like you said, it's a star-driven league in a world that's so me, me, me. I just want the focus to be on our group and our team and what we do.

I think that it's kind of tiring -- I think the In-Season Tournament has been really good because -- and us having success has been good because it's forced the media to talk about basketball and talk about what's in front of you and not have to talk about legacies and all the BS that comes with it and actually talk about basketball.",
"I think that's what's been good about us succeeding. Of course, there's going to be -- people have said MVP, All-NBA, All-Star, whatever if that happens, but at the end of the day I just want to play basketball, and I want to succeed as a team, and I know individual success comes with that.

I think that's been something that I've really enjoyed about our run right now is that it's forced the media to talk about what's in front of them, which is basketball.

I think as a person who loves the sport, I think everybody can appreciate that.",
"Yeah, I think just paying attention to what has worked for us and understanding that we can beat anybody. We've proven that. I think just ultimately, it's same as always. You go back, watch the film on this game, see what we can learn from that, and just keep growing.

That's the great thing about playing 82 games. We play again on Monday. I know everybody thinks they're like a genius to say that we need to play more defense or whatever the case may be, but that's the great thing about 82 games, is we get time to grow in that.",
"Our offense, we get time to grow in that, as well. That's the beautiful thing about the NBA and basketball in general.

I think just keep growing, keep learning, and not viewing the season, and I think it's easy for a young team to look -- especially now that we've tasted some success to look so far ahead and be like, oh, by the time we get to February, by the time we get to the Playoffs. It can't be that.

It's got to be what's in front us. We understand that. So, this game we can frustrated by; watch the film tomorrow; but we play the Pistons on Monday, so we've got to move on and just take it one day at a time.",
"Yeah, ultimately it's trust your eyes, trust what's in front of you. I think people see how we play and how fun it looks and think I'm a player that people want to play with.

So at the end of the day, I can help and I talk to guys and everybody talked about USA and the constant recruiting that goes within USA and stuff like that, but my job is just to play basketball.",
"If guys want to come play with Indy, I'm going to be here. I'm waiting whenever guys want to come. But we've got a great group of guys in our locker room as we speak and I'm focused on that right now.

It's the NBA, there's a lot of moving parts, but I'm focused on the guys in our locker room right now and continuing on with the season.",
"That's a fair question. Me and Brock went to school together. Came into school together. We both started both as freshmen. That's somebody I can really call a friend. To see what he's doing and succeeding the way he is, that's really cool to see, especially being from Iowa State where it's not a school that's expected to have this much success at the professional level in any sport.

It's cool to see my brother do well. And yeah, like you said, from the moment that he started out, I was showing him nothing but love. It was cool, in college, Coach [Matt] Campbell, the football coach, we used to have leadership meetings, me, Brock and Coach Campbell, and we had a book we'd read and we used to talk about different stuff.

That was cool. Just seeing him succeed and seeing him doing what he's doing, it means a lot to me and it means a lot to Iowa State fans in general to see us guys doing that. Hopefully it's a good recruiting tool for the Cyclones moving forward.",
