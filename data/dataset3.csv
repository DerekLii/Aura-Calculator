"Sure. I don't know. This is my first time being in a tournament like this. I don't know what takes place if you win the whole thing. I saw a trophy out there, but I don't know if this counts on your resume, if I get a banner, if you get a ring. I heard you get some money if you win.",
"No, it's weird. It feels weird being in Vegas during the NBA season. But yeah, I'll say it's weird. This whole thing is weird.",
"Nothing. I enjoy the process. It felt like an NBA game. I felt like the hype was maybe around the game a little bit different. But for me, it felt like just an NBA game.",
"I think it's great. I think it just brings a little bit more attention to the game of basketball, and some of those games count.",
"I think we scored, what, 140 points? I don't remember if we scored 140 points again this season, but this was the first game that we actually beat a team by 20, and we were up in the fourth quarter and guys were able to go in and play, our young guys, which that's a good feeling. I feel like a lot of games we've played this year have been close games.",
"What else? But I didn't think we had the potential to score 140 points, as you guys saw last night, but at the end of the day you cannot expect that you're going to score 140 points a game. You guys have been around for a long time. You know that. We've got to start from our defense. We've got to be better defensively, try to eliminate whatever we're trying to eliminate. I don't want to put our game plan out there. On days when we score 140 points, the games are going to be easier. If we score 110 points, hopefully we have a chance to win.",
"At the end of the day, everybody is locked in and we are making shots and the ball is moving and we are able to get in the paint and also get open shots, not only get open shots, make open shots, we are a very, very dangerous team, same as Indiana. Indiana plays extremely fast, move the ball, try to play as many open shots as possible as they can and any given night they can score 120, 140. One night they can score 80. They're a dangerous team. Obviously, they have a great coach, too.",
" The best birthday gift I ever received, I think when you say the wish, the wishes come true, so I cannot tell you the wish.",
" It feels good. It feels good. Obviously, a little bit sore today. But it is what it is. You get some treatment, you sleep a little bit, ice it, elevate it. Hopefully it feels better in the morning.",
"Yeah, even like yesterday we won by 20, but they scored 120 points. That's not who we are. We are able to keep teams under 100 in the last previous years. We've got to get better. Right now, I think we're not even top 20 in defense, and that's not who we are. In order to be really good, you have to be top 10 offense, top 10 defense history shows. So we've got to be better.",
"No, I'll say the urgency in those games is definitely higher than just a regular-season game. If I compare it to a playoff game, I don't know. But for sure there's meaning behind the game now.",
"Yeah, no, win or lose, it's going to be a good thing. Win or lose. You want to play as many games like this as you can. You know that they're high stakes, whatever, that there's meaning behind it.",
"You only get better from these games, and I think for sure it's going to accelerate our chemistry.",
"No, I wouldn't say that. Because we all know the season is going to continue, regardless of what happens, I don't think it's the same. When you get to the Playoffs, this is it. Somebody got to go home.",
"When it's high stakes, something to be had -- it's a super, super competitive league. It's something different. The opportunity to just be here in Vegas in the middle of the season is different.",
"Man, I was like, Vegas in December, this is different. You see all the hotels when we pull up, it's like, man, we're actually in Vegas. It's crazy. What do I do? Do I just go to sleep or what?",
" I mean, I wouldn't expect a banner. I think whoever wins it is going to go down in history as the first person to win it. I think that's the beauty in that.

But I'll just take the money. Give us what we came here for, and that would be great.

But to win the Cup, it would be a great thing for our team, like I said. Obviously we're here to win it, regardless, just as competitors and people who love the game. But I don't know, man, I think as far as a celebration, you just continue to build on it and take it for what it is. We're the last team standing in this specific competition, and it'll be something for us to build on.

But for me personally, it's not going to be like, oh, we won something. I'm interested in winning in June more than anything. But like I said, this is a great opportunity for us to accomplish something that's happening for the first time and also something for us to build on.",
" I don't know yet. I ain't just going to go blow it or nothing. But I've got a few people that could probably use some assistance, and I think it would feel like it's not coming directly out of my pocket. I'd probably look out for a few people.",
" I don't know, I have a hard time saying that this situation is going to prepare us for the Playoffs because that's just a different thing. But I think it's a part of that process, of us just being together. I think that's going to be the number one thing is us just being together, continuing to get to know each other. And more so than something being at stake, I think it's just being in those moments where we develop trust and comfort with each other, and over time I think that's what it's going to be.",
" I would like to see better designs for the courts. That's one thing. I'm not sure right now what else I would change. I think the format is pretty solid. I think it's something that was well thought out. There's not much that I would change off the top of my head. I'm sure when I walk away there will be a couple things I can think of, but I think it's pretty solid.",
"Money. I mean, that's how you're going to get people to -- sweeten the pot.",
" I think it's between me and Brook, it's just a lot of communication about it. A lot of times we end up in the locker room at the same time. When we're going through like our warmup, we wind up standing there, me and him organically having a lot of conversation since I've been here. But also I think a lot of times where we're running the most pick-and-roll is in the second group when me and Brook are in the game together. He's just always coming up to me like, do you want me to change the angle, do you want me to set it higher, set random screens? It's just the communication. I think me playing off of him, the way his guy is staying in front of me and he's getting wide-open threes or he's diving down the middle and he's right at the rim, I think the communication and him seeing how much he'll benefit from it and how much it can help our team is just flowing a little bit better.",
But I wouldn't say give somebody a playoff spot based off of this. A lot of things can change from now until playoff time.,
The only thing I would think of is just the prize. What can we do to up the prize? That's it.,
"I think in time, everything will come together as it should and we'll have as good of a chance as anybody.",
"We understand what it takes. We all have the experience. We all have the ability. I think our personalities go well together, as well.",
"I think one thing we have on our side is our experience. It's not like I'm coming in here as a fifth- or sixth-year player. None of our guys are 24, 25 that are coming into the situation.",
"We can also build on it as a team. I think this is a confidence builder, and it just feels good. Being here just feels good for our team, and I think for us individually it's something to be had.",
"But like I said, it's doing what it's supposed to do. Having an opportunity to be here is almost like a break from the season but not a break from the season. We get to take a little trip and have an opportunity to reach a prize that, like I've said before, could impact a lot of our younger teammates and our staff. It could do something for people.",
"I think it's doing what it's supposed to do. A lot of teams who probably didn't appreciate it in the first one or two In-Season Tournament games are probably wishing like, man, we should have took this a little more serious for this opportunity.",
"Everything that's going into it, I think it makes it what it is. It gives that excitement and that different level of competition and care that you don't usually get in December in an NBA season.",
"But it's just one of those things where it's an opportunity to be the last man standing. There's a prize in the end that could have an impact on a lot of people involved, and we've got an opportunity at it.",
"In this situation, we're going to go home but we're going to go home to more games and there's still opportunity to be there in the end. So I wouldn't compare it to that.",
"Now, if it happens, it happens. If it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen. We'll come back next year and try it again. But again, for sure it accelerates our chemistry, but we have a lot of games moving forward.",
"
I really believe in the group that we have, and I believe as long as we stay on the same page, as long as everybody do what they have to do -- not more, just be good, do your role, nothing more, and be able to sacrifice, sometimes take a step backwards in order for you to take 10 steps forward, we are going to be good. Yeah, we have a chance.",
"But again, it's 22 games into the season, man. It's very, very early. It's very, very early",
"Obviously, there's a lot of things that takes place in order for you to win the game, but win or lose, it's going to be good for our team. Win or lose, it's going to be very, very good for our team. We're going to learn because we want to be in a moment like this again hopefully. Might be Playoffs, Round 1, Round 2, Round 3, Round 4. There's going to be times that we have to prepare for a game which if we get knocked out, we go back home. If we lose the game, our season ends.",
"You prepare to win. Just not to prepare just to prepare. Obviously, we say we prepare to win, but -- I'm not going to say our life is depending on it, but we want to win. We want to win.",
"But again, not for my team. My team plays hard every single night. But yeah, for sure there's more urgency behind the games.",
"So, you'll probably see teams playing harder.",
"But at the end of the day, I don't think we can just rely on like scoring 122 points to beat a team that scores 120. We've got to keep teams under 100, and it's very hard to do in the NBA because everybody is very talented. But we've got to be able to do that.",
"But I think we are better defensively now even though they scored 120 than we were two, three, four, five weeks ago. If we make those improvements and we keep on believing in the game plan that we've built to now, we're going to be better, I believe. If we are not, we are not. What can I say? We have to get the ball to Dame for him to score 70 again. We have that option, too.",
"What's the best birthday I've had? I don't know. Maybe last year. Last year I had all my family -- my brother was on a two-way with the Chicago Bulls, my other brother was with Oshkosh, so all of my brothers except my older one were together in Milwaukee, and I had a night that I could spend with them. So probably that because usually on my birthday everybody is all over the place. Kostas a couple years ago was in LA, Alex Toronto, then he was in Spain, then Kostas went to France. We were just all over the place. Last year was the first time that we were able to spend some time together as a family, so probably last year.",
"But when the wish come true, I'll tell you. When I see you again, I'll tell you if it came true or not.",
"But at the end of the day, with the game plan that we have moving forward, I think it gives us a chance to put ourselves in a position to win games easier.",
"I don't think there's anything to tweak. Yeah, I don't think there's anything else. I think it's great so far.",
"If we had lost the game yesterday, we wouldn't be in this position we are today, but if it was just a regular-season game, who would have cared. I just think it brings more attention to our game.",
"Okay, with the other things they did, they changed the courts and some jerseys, I think the NBA did a great job just building hype around it and kind of making it different from a regular-season game because in the old days if you watch the game you can tell it's not just a regular season game, it's a play-in, In-Season Tournament game, whatever it's called.",
"But yeah, I'm just trying to soak in all this experience, enjoy it as much as possible.",
"But hey, if we get -- first of all, we've got to win Indiana, very good team, young team, plays fast. But if we win the whole thing, it would be great to maybe have a banner, too. Who knows, I don't care.",
"But at the end of the day, it's a great experience. It's something that I've never gone through before. So, I'm trying to soak it in as much as I can, enjoy the moment as much as I can, enjoy the game. Whatever the outcome is, I know that I'll leave this place with a great experience. I had my birthday in Vegas. That's what I'm going to tell my kids one day. My 29th birthday was in Las Vegas. What were you doing out there, dad? Were you gambling and being in the gentlemen's club? No, no, I was playing a basketball game. Basketball game? What?",
"But as I told you guys yesterday, before I go back to Milwaukee, I'll probably spend it in the casino downstairs in our hotel, play it on 34 red. But yeah, if we beat Indiana, then we beat the next team, it would be great to see another banner, and it's going to be crazy because whoever wins this whole thing is going to have one upped Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Kobe, Shaq. I guess I'm better than them. [Laughter].",
" I think yesterday is when it finally hit me. After the game on Saturday, I was just so pumped up and so thrilled still that we got the victory and that the series is over and that we're moving on to the Finals, I didn't get a chance to just decompress and just sit down and just think about it. When I got on the plane yesterday and got to the hotel room and I was actually by myself for a change, that's when it hit me. Yeah, like we're the Finals now, and it was a big accomplishment.",
"But like you said, it's a first for me. First time in the playoffs in four years too, so being able to get a chance to go about each round and compete in every series and get to this point with this amazing group of guys is great.",
"It's great. I think this NBA season has been great. With all the COVID testing we had to do, all the protocols we had to follow and things like that, and being around these guys more than basically my family, we've become brothers and become really, really close. So, getting a chance to compete for a championship knowing that all the hard work we put in through training camp and the highs and lows of the NBA season and things like that to get to this point, it's a special moment.",
"Just stay together knowing that every possession matters, being together, staying in the moment, just trying to burn the motor out. Ain't no tomorrow. We've got seven games to win four, and I'm just trying to blow the motor out and go as hard as I can and get them all.",
"Trae has the ball a lot in his hand. Like you said, in the last series they come off the pick-and-roll. Guys will roll, we'll switch and he'll attack the bigs wherever it is. I think the biggest thing with this series, when we switch on these guys, they'll throw it across the court and back up to half-court and charge at you.",
"So not trying to foul and get in foul trouble, knowing that Chris Paul and Devin Booker are great guys that can make you foul them and get you in foul trouble.",
"Toughness. He brings that mental physicality that you need to win in the league. All guys, all teams need a guy like him on your roster that do all the little things. It's just not about scoring with him, whether he's making shots or missing them. He's the same way every day. Brings that dog to the team, brings that toughness that every team needs, like I said, getting all the loose balls, fighting for the offensive rebounds, coming out of the corners and getting rebounds, things like that. Always gets a big rebound every game.",
"He does all the little things for our basketball team that we really, really need, and he's great in his role. He plays it to a T.",
" I think some of the advantages we have is we're a big team, just pounding the ball inside, like we did last series. We tried to own the paint last series. I think that's going to be a big emphasis for us.",
"This moment is special. Growing up as a kid watching KG [Kevin Garnett] versus Kobe in the Finals, LeBron all those years and things like that, so being able to be a kid from Little Rock, Arkansas, being able to represent myself, my team, this organization, my family, and my state on the biggest stage in basketball is remarkable, man.",
"All the hard work I put in, being able to be in the NBA Finals is a dream come true, and it's a special moment.",
"Coming into the game with the right mindset. Obviously playing on the road and winning on the road is a big deal. You always want to get at least one. So being locked in from the jump, following the game plan, following what Coach wants us to do, everybody being on one accord and going out there and just giving it their all.",
"Like I said, man, there isn't any tomorrow. We've got seven games to win four, so I think everybody has to blow the motor out, go as hard as they can, stay locked in on the task at hand.",
What was the second question again?,
" I think the biggest keys of the series is guys staying out of foul trouble. Not falling for some of the tactics they're going to do. Obviously, they do a good job of getting the refs involved and getting people in foul trouble and staying on their game. Just staying locked in. We know not falling into some of the tactics they want to do and just being who we are every day. Everybody playing their role, playing with confidence, playing with swag, and going out there and just enjoying the moment.",
"Obviously, when you get to this stage in basketball, some guys don't live in the moment, and I think it's big for us to live in the moment, take it one game at a time, one possession at a time, and go out there and just give it our all.",
" It's big, man. Obviously, me, Bryn, Jeff and Pat, we're the catalysts of the second unit. We have to come in and be ourselves and come in and bring some energy to the game, some scoring and things like that. So, I think it's going to be very vital to help out the starting lineups and things like that.",
They do a good job on their end too with Cameron Payne and Saric and those guys. Cam Johnson as well coming off the bench and scoring the basketball and bringing some energy to the game.,
"I think whoever has the most energy and plays with the most effort is going to win these games. That's what it's really going to come down to. Obviously, it's July. Guys have been playing since December, and it was a short offseason last year. I think whoever is the most conditioned, the most well rounded, and the most energetic team is going to obviously come out victorious.",
" I think it prepared us well. Obviously, Miami, they're a tough-minded team. They bring the physicality to the game, try to dog you out. They play hard, play physical. Brooklyn, they're a different team. They play small ball. They had three of the best players in the world on one team. The Hawks were a young team that's going to be a tough team for years to come, and this team, they have a Hall of Famer in Chris Paul that's led young guys to the Finals.",
"So obviously, each series has been different, but for us, we've just tried to be ourselves and follow the game plan that Coach has put in place for us in every series, and it's worked so far. I think, if we just follow our game plan, everybody comes in, be themselves, and I think everything will fall in our favor if we just play with swagger and play with confidence.",
I knew that was going to come up.,
"Everything he's doing now, like I said, we knew, we just knew, and when you've been around and played against a bunch of guys, in this fraternity, we all know each other. We all played against each other. We all knew that he was going to be really good. Like he wasn't just good, he was really good.",
"Being his teammate at that time and being the vet on the team, it was my job to make him better. I knew what I had to do for what he was going to see and what was coming and what he needed to be ready for. So I would literally just -- (laughing), it was like that. It was really like that. But he like showed that he was one of the ones. He just like took it, and he just elevated. He became who he is and who he's continuing to be. He's -- yeah. Yeah.",
"Yeah, new place.",
"Yeah, I seen it -- people were talking about it before, but I knew if that came together, that would be strong. It wasn't just that, it was other pieces they were putting together, too. Getting Jae, doing a bunch of little things that they did, they put together a complete team, and they were going to have a chance. They've shown it all year. They've played well all year long.",
"Even their hot start, people were thinking they were going to fall. But they just kept going. You know when you get those two together, if you get the right pieces around them, you're going to have a pretty good team.",
"That is actually really awkward because I do have -- this is like a second home for me. Yeah, people I know and love here, like of course. But no. I'm sorry, no. No.",
"Phoenix is honestly everything to me. Like, I literally turned down my contract I had to go back to Russia, which was the biggest contract I was ever going to sign, and it was a really big decision for me to do that. I wasn't happy about it at first, but my wife and agent talked me into it, and it ended up being the best decision I ever made in my life and it changed my life. So I'm super grateful and indebted to Phoenix and the staff and the people that were here, Robert Sarver, all of them.",
"I still don't know yet, like the whole Finals, it's crazy because every year when you fight to try to get to this moment, and through everything, the injuries, the team, like everything teams go through to regroup and change some pieces and you think you've still got a shot and then you really don't, and then you get traded and you change and now your perspective changes and taking hits and fighting, fighting, fighting, and to actually be here before a game, it's hard to put it in perspective yet.",
I'm super excited. Been working for this moment all my life.,
"I love how that turned into I'm not rooting for the Suns so fast (Laughter). No, no, I'm not talking to many people. This is it. This is the time to lock in and take care of business. I love everybody, but right now -- after this is over, then we can go back to loving each other. This is a battle. This is war. It is what it is.",
"First, for the switching defense, it's always a problem. You're getting a lot of what are presumed to be mismatches on sometimes centers on guards. We've done that pretty much most of the playoffs -- Brooklyn, Atlanta. It's tough. No matter what, at this level, at this point, all the guards are really good. They can all score. Even putting guards on bigs now, it's tough trying to rebound.",
"That's something we carry heavy on our shoulders. Guys know to guard their own, be able to guard to take guys off the glass, being able to help and fight with each other, that's just a part of it. Obviously, it's going to pose that situation a lot of times, but we like our chances. We like our guys out there.",
I forgot what you asked first. Leadership?,
" I don't know. I think Chris is Chris. Like people can -- you can dumb it down. You can say whatever you want about him. Like he's Chris, like Chris is going to be Chris. He's going to be him no matter what. I don't know you dumb somebody like that down. He's just going to be Chris, and I guess that's been good enough to get him where they're at, so I think it works.",
"Man, we just played Atlanta, I don't know how many hours ago. We were home for a nap, and then we got right on the plane to Phoenix. I have no idea what shoes I've got, and I could care less as long as they lace up and I can wear them, that's all I care about. This is probably the first time in my life I could care less what shoes I'm wearing.",
"Wow, that is -- hmm. We were playing at OKC New Year's Eve, and Alvin Gentry just walked in was like, P.J., you start. I was like, What? He goes, you're starting. Mind you, I'm like 15th man for sure, and he's just like, yeah, you're starting. I was like all right (laughing). All right. And I started from then on out. That was my first year, New Year's Eve. I'll never forget that.",
"I don't know. It's like all the cliche stuff, it's easy to say. Don't give up. Keep fighting. But you can say that stuff and still not work out. You guys, it's got to be a little luck, a little of this, a little of that. I don't know. I could sit here and say all that stuff, and it's like all right, whatever.",
"No, honestly, it is that stuff, though. Like I worked my butt off for years and still never got a chance. It never made sense. It never added up being in the right situation, in the wrong situation, until it all just comes together finally, and once it does, you know it. It just happens, and you can kind of keep going from there, but a lot of things had to change too. The game changed a little bit from when I first came in the league. It started to shift, and people started needing different things, and those niches everybody talks about, you started to be able to fill those things.",
"So, a lot of things have to change and have to work in your favor, and it worked for me.",
We tried to prep for this yesterday so we could keep it as normal as possible. We changed a few things up so we could get what we needed in and then allow for media to come in and do what you guys have to do.,
"But as far as us, it was a good day, locked in, focused. We have been waiting to play, so the guys, they're just ready to go. One more drill from me encouraged all kind of looks, but the preparation has been good for us and the focus has been really good.",
"The pressure they put on the paint has been pretty consistent, even with Giannis [out], but you see a different way of doing it now with Jrue attacking and Lopez diving. That's been something that we have to respect. You have to respect them anyway with Giannis getting into the paint -- in transition, in isolation, when he dives in the pick-and-roll, especially with Middleton. So without Giannis, there seems to be a different way of attacking the paint. And then all of their guys that crash the boards. When Giannis is down there with Lopez, they're so big there's really no room, it seems like, for other guys. Now you got Connaughton going. You got P.J. going a ton. Portis is down there. Everybody they bring in the game pretty much is going to get an offensive rebound. So they haven't stopped playing the way they want to play. The pressure on the paint has been pretty consistent in the playoffs.",
"Yeah, I would love to tell you yeah, but you don't know. You're confident that they will because we have been a resilient group. We have dealt with a lot. We have always talked about poise. That was a talk after that game, about how we can't, obviously, beat ourselves, which sounds like coach-speak, but that was part of the talk. It was them talking about it. They knew it, and so I didn't have to do it as much.",
"As far as being confident about our group, yeah, I'm always confident that we're going to bounce back. I've said this to the local media here. We always have, after a loss or a setback, a remorseful group, especially when we self-inflict on the floor. That's what we expect. We always expect to bounce back.",
"That's hard. I don't think you ever -- you just want to get there, you know what I mean? And as a head coach, I don't have time to do all of that. I'm just focused on the things necessary to get wins. That's all I'm thinking about. I can't stop and think about my feelings or -- human nature leads you there sometimes, and then I snap out of it and I just move on to the next objective, which is more film, conversations with the coaches and players, that kind of thing. Obviously there's a level of gratitude to be in this position, but you move on from that and you start to strategize and figure out ways to maximize the moment.",
" I think the guys feel really good about where we are. We have had a few days to heal and get back in the gym, and we have had some really good practices. Yesterday was one of our more competitive practices. The spirit was great. Guys are ready to play. That's been the sentiment for the last couple of days. Guys are ready to get out there and hoop against somebody else.",
"Yeah, I think they've done a great job so far this year. Like you said, some of it is just uncontrollable. Some of these injuries that you've seen in these past couple weeks and months, there's just nothing you can really do to prevent that. Luck has to be a portion of that for sure, but I think our strength staff, our training staff, they do a great job of injury prevention stuff and rehabbing whatever might be wrong. So, big shoutout to them for sure.",
"I don't know, man.",
" For sure. I'm not going to try to waste my time by just half-assing it. I'm going to give it my all. I'm going to work to be the best I can. I may not be the greatest, but I feel like I can be the best version of myself.",
" I guess you could say that. I really couldn't tell you or give you, I guess, what you want to hear. I think Book is a fantastic player. He's a younger player than myself. So he's worked on his game. He's missed the playoffs for however many years he's been in the league and he's here in The Finals, the first time in these playoffs, which I think is pretty cool and tough to do. So it tells you the type of person he is, how hard he works, how much he believes in his organization too.",
" I couldn't tell you, man. I expected him to play the next game or come back the day he got injured. He still wasn't out there, so I couldn't tell you.",
" Just tell him to do what's best for himself and his family. Don't rush back in and put yourself at a greater risk for a greater injury. But he's a guy, like you know, he puts in so much time and effort into his body to be the best version of himself also. So, yeah.",
"It's been great. I think the biggest guy that had to adjust the most is Brook. I mean, he's a guy that's 7 feet that sometimes has to switch onto point guards, shooting guards. They try to take advantage of him, but he does a great job of using his size, his length, to contest shots and keep guys in front of him.",
"He's a guy that has a lot of experience in that. In his whole career, he's been a guy that's guarded 1 through 5. So to have him on our team, to give us the confidence to go ahead and throw those different lineups out there and rely on him in a lot of different situations, it's been great.",
"Yeah, just a team that's trying to play unselfish, trying to do it as a committee. When Giannis is out there, a lot of times we can just give him the ball and let him go to work and let him orchestrate a lot of things out there. Without him, we have to do it by committee, moving the ball around, driving it a little bit more, playing just a little bit faster with a little bit of different flow. But I think guys have done a great job of adjusting with him out, with him not out there in two of the most important games of our season.",
"I think it's huge. A lot of coaches' and teams' schemes, they want you to shoot threes and layups. That's what a lot of teams expect you to do. But when you stop sometimes, they just don't expect it. It gives you a clean look. So if you work on it, it almost seems like a layup or a three-point shot for myself.",
"It's cool. Everything is a first for us. Like, this is my first Media Day for something like this. So we're all trying to stay locked in as much as we can, not think about the outside influences of it being the NBA Finals. Just trying to take it one game at a time.",
Just stay the course. Not try to think about too much except for what I need to do on the basketball court. Try to not get rattled when things aren't going my way. Don't get too cocky when things are going my way. Just staying the course and just working for it.,
"Just a guy that hits tough shots, a guy that can score from the three, the mid-range and the paint, a guy that can get to the free throw line. He's a guy that really can score in every single way, which is tough to guard because you don't know when he's going to stop and shoot, when he's going to keep going, when he's going to look to create for others. It's just a great balance he has.",
"I think everything we have been through is just experience. You learn from it. The postseason failures we have had so far, we have found a way to use that as motivation and just use that and let it teach us how to be better, how to be better people, how to be better players.",
"He was a teammate of mine, and not just a teammate. I say this all the time. Willie is like a brother to me, family. His family, his wife, his kids, everything. To have him as a coach, I couldn't imagine going through this season without having Willie here.",
"Willie just gets it. When you play in this league -- I always talk about that Golden State series, Game 7, and his locker was right next to mine. I didn't have a really good first half and he was the one who told me, he said, You got to be more aggressive, C. So he's just always been the guy that I could talk to about anything. He pushes me. I think for him, not only being a good player in his own right, that time he spent with the Warriors and those championship teams, so there's nothing in this league Willie hasn't seen.",
"Man, one thing about our league and its players is everything is always a conversation. There's a ton of guys on the executive committee who are working hard on things right now as we speak -- day in and day out, traveling. I wish you guys knew all the things that are going on. So decisions that are made as far as playing or not playing, players are always involved in it. Injuries are always unfortunate. You hate to have them. But just like when we went to the bubble, everything was discussed as far as the players and the full body of players. Everything that's good for this guy and that guy might not be the same for that guy, but everything has always been a conversation and it's going to continue to be that way. So if people don't like it, then you know everybody has the same opportunity to be a part of all these conversations.",
"It's different. Obviously I haven't practiced here and not at the practice facility, but it's still basketball. I think we're all locked into the goal at hand. And not much, just, I don't know. It's weird no games being on. I usually watch games every day. So that's probably the part that sucks. That's probably the part that sucks the most. But I would rather be playing than not. Other than that, just life.",
"Probably. I don't know. I'm usually on the phone with my kids day in and day out, seeing what they got going on. And just getting ready, practicing, body work, all that different type stuff. So, yeah, I don't even know. I'm focused.",
"Jrue is just the consummate team guy. Plays the game the right way, defends, can score. My family knows, like my parents, I think, know his family very well and stuff. He's just like a good guy, like a great guy. I'm sure they're excited to have him, and that's what's going to make this series so tough.",
"I honestly have no clue how they have started off every series. I think for us it's just about winning games. Winning games and making sure that we have the right approach as a team. But those two guys are two leaders of our team, so obviously we go off them. We feed off them. But we expect that not only at the beginning of a series, but in the middle of a series, at the end of a series -- like, that's why you're in that role.",
"You're not at practice with me every day. I think for us it's balance in whatever it is. You always got to remember, this is a kid's game that we play, you know what I mean? This is a blessing and an opportunity to play this game. So it's balance. I think our team knows when to lock in and when we got to enjoy the moment and enjoy ourselves.",
"Man, Chris say everything to me. He tells me when I'm playing well, when I'm playing bad. I think that's probably the most exciting part is my kids are of the age that they know everything that's going on. My daughter, who hasn't been a fan of any of my games my whole career, I think that's probably what touched me after the Western Conference Finals, to see her with emotions and see her so excited. So, yeah, just enjoying the process and all the different moments of it. But ready to go.",
