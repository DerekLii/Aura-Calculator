Quote,Aura Points
"I mean, a lot of it was kind of myself kind of leading the charge and settling too much. At home in the fourth quarter, I felt like we could go for that dagger punch and didn't really put any pressure on the defense getting to the paint and trying to force the issue that way, and really just kind of settled too much. That's something that is tough to kind of swallow with the opportunity we had in front of us.",
"So win or lose, you appreciate the stage we were on and just that back and forth that we live for.",
"It doesn't matter how good or bad defense I played, he made the shot. So credit to him. He stepped up and took advantage of the moment. It was not a good feeling turning around and seeing it go in.",
"Of course. I didn't play efficient. I had some good moments, but didn't do enough to help my team win, especially down the stretch. I was aggressive, but in the wrong ways settling.",
"I think it's a big deal just to be part of the legacy. I think that would make my legacy a little underrated for the outside looking in. But for my family, my fans, my friends, they know what I've been through here and they know who I've crossed paths with, and to be able to stand next to LeBron and AD and guys like that and win a championship, I don't know if it will go unnoticed to a lot of people but for me it will be a huge deal. I could officially say that I would be a diehard Laker fan at that point, right. It's a big deal.",
It will haunt me for a while because it means a lot to me to try to lead my team and do what I need to do on the court and big stages. Done it before. Didn't do it tonight. It will be good down the stretch or next year coming back and kind of remembering this feeling and being an even better player.,
"There's no room for anecdotes other than we didn't get it done, and I didn't play my best for the majority of the series.",
"It's not a good feeling, like I said. At the end of the day, we want to keep this memory so that it will fuel us as we stay together as a team. Because like Draymond said, this ain't the last time you're going to see us on this stage. Just a tough feeling.",
"So hat's off to him. Winning a championship is no easy task, and he was able to accomplish it with his guys. So you congratulate him. If I do see him, that's basically what I'd say. Enjoy. Obviously he's done it before, but enjoy the moment. They definitely deserve it. They played their butts off and got it done.",
"Just the energy. They play with a lot of pace. Tyrese does a hell of a job leading their whole team. The way they play offensively, super fast, a lot of threes. But just the pace that they play with, we are going to have to be on high alert.I mean, I don't think there is -- I mean, there isn't any surgery or anything in my future this summer. I need to get healthier, but there is no excuses for what happened on the floor. I was out there, ready to play. I had a some good games; I had some bad games. And that's it. I'll come back stronger next season and be ready to go.",
"We learn from what it was like to win a championship last year, which I think made us the best regular season team in history, and we'll learn from how the playoff run went when we get back here next year.",
"I mean, it doesn't help missing the time, but that was never an excuse for me when I came back from the injury. I've always said if I'm out there playing, hurt or not hurt, it doesn't matter. It's what the results are. And that stays true to till today.",
"I think we've obviously been on the other side of the situation last year, and know how great a feeling that is when you accomplish your goal. I think me and him were kind of just waiting for it to calm down a little bit so we could congratulate the individual guys. Because the competition was amazing in the series, and that's what basketball's all about.",
"But at the end of the day, you congratulate them for accomplishing what they set out to do, and it will be a good image for us over the summer and all next season to remember so that we can come back stronger.",
"I got to be better. I got to be more aggressive finding my shot. I got to do more things to get my team going. I think I was too laid back tonight. Just, I can't do that. Defensively, I got to be better.",
"I don't know. I mean, we had a great regular season. Did something no team's done before. Fell short in the last game of the season. It hurts, man. I mean, that's all I'm really kind of marinating on right now.",
"Just proud of every single guy that stepped foot on the floor for our team this year. It wasn't easy what we accomplished, and it's not an easy pill to swallow what we didn't accomplish.",
Understand that we hopefully will have many more opportunities to fight for championships and be on this stage because it is what it's all about. Proud of every single one of our guys that helped us get here.,
"But there's no denying what he was able to accomplish this series. He played pretty great basketball, made some timely shots. Definitely was a huge reason they got it done.",
"Whine about it tonight, a lot of wine, a lot of beer, a couple shots, maybe like 20 of them, digest it, get back to work tomorrow. Nothing you can do.",
"I mean, we let a huge opportunity slip away, so I'm upset, hurt, disappointed.",
"It's a huge loss, no doubt about it. We'll just get back to work tomorrow.",
I'm not thinking about beating them three straight. We're thinking about beating them on Sunday. Then you move on from there.,
"Take one swing at a time to chop down a tree. We gave them a lot of fast-break points, allowed them to get back in the game with free throws and three-point opportunities. That's a deadly combination.",
"No, I'm a realist. It happened. It is what it is. At the same time there's a lot of positive things that we did.",
"We've got to take the good things that we did well in this game, understand what we did wrong in the third quarter and move on from there. We'll take care of business on Sunday.",
"Well, I think they did a good job forcing us to take difficult shots. I think their defense picked up, but all in all, we did a much better job in the first half getting back on defense.",
We've got to do a better job of cutting back on those easy opportunities and not putting them to the free-throw line and giving them timely three-point opportunities.,
"I think it's a combination of both, always. It's a combination of their defense, a combination of our poor execution.",
"But it's time for us to get back to the basics, understand what we did right and try to impose our will next game.",
"There was no difference. They were determined to not let me beat them tonight. I saw three, four bodies every time I touched the ball.",
"No, not right now. Right now I think it's normal for everybody to be a little disappointed, a little pissed off.",
It's human nature. But tomorrow you've just got to get back to work.,
"You just need to kind of read the flow of the game. Like I said, I saw three, four bodies all night.",
"It was about making a pass and trying to get guys open opportunities. If they don't have open opportunities, then move the ball. But in terms of my personal rhythm, it's a little bit more difficult to get going when you've got three, four guys running at you.",
"But I think we did some positive things, and we'll look to go back to that the next game.",
"Nothing. We just wet the bed. A nice big one, too, one of the ones you can't put a towel over. It was terrible.",
"Nothing you can do about it. They played great in the third quarter, we played like crap.",
"They pulled out a great win, now it's time to move on to the next one, period.",
"If they were going to foul anybody, I wanted it to be me and go to the free-throw line.",
"I just made my move, and I looked up and he was behind me and I had the whole basket free and clear. It worked out for me that time.",
"Well, a lot has been made of this team and the players on it. We've said all year that we're still learning each other.",
"We've been put in situations where we've been tested throughout the regular season, and really the regular season doesn't mean anything because you get to the playoffs and the first couple rounds we have them on the road.",
"So we've learned a lot about ourselves. And we're still a fairly new team, and coming into these situations, we just said, just fight.",
"No matter what's going to happen, just fight, do what you can do, play as hard as you can play, and we'll see how we end up. But nobody is ever going to quit.",
"There were a lot of times where I may have passed up a lot of open shots, but I know at least making a play for my teammate is going to make us a better team in the long run.",
We have to take -- the preparations are going to be the same.,
"We have to come in this building, a hostile building, we have to come in here and we have to get a win. ",
"It's not going to be easy, so we'll take the two days to prepare for what we're going to face in their adjustments.",
But I think we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. We've got to take care of business.,
"Well, I think that's something to talk about in the papers and on TV, but as a team, a team that has been trying to strive for excellence all year, we made it our deal to not worry about stats, not worry about who the leading scorer was, how many rebounds we got.",
We just wanted to play basketball. At this point it's the same thing. We have a task at hand.,
We have a game that we have to play and we have to win. So we're not going to get too worried about what's on the other side of the fence yet.,
"The joy and the journey and the process that we've talked about all year long, you know, enjoy the process and continue the process, because the process is going to get us to where we want to go.",
"So we've been pretty good, and we've respected each other and we've competed.",
"Well, I think as a team, I said earlier that we grew. We've grown all year from the regular season.",
"As tough as it was, as frustrating as it was, I had to figure out ways to make plays for the team.",
"That was a learning point for all of us, making sure that we made plays for the team and just did the simple things over and over again.",
"Oh, I look forward to the two days, although I would love to play again on Saturday having the time off.",
"Sometimes it can break you up a little bit too much, but being able to play is what we would love to do.",
"There was a point out there in the game where I knew I wasn't coming out, and I just said I have to suck it up. I have plenty of time to rest the next couple of months, so suck it up.",
"But with all that, man, we still had a chance to win this game. We let it slip right through our hands.",
Never could really get into a rhythm. I was playing on my heels the whole night. I thought Pau had a real good game.,
"He was aggressive, I thought he had a real good game. I thought they had a big impact on the game.",
My play tonight? It was trash. I played like garbage tonight. I can do better and I will.,
"But tonight is what it's about, it's the present, and it was terrible. I've definitely got to do better.",
"Series-wise, myself, just trying to get myself, my team an edge, trying to close this thing out. I always say there's always room for improvement.",
Hopefully we can close this thing out at home. But the onus is on us. I don't think there's any pressure at this point.,
"I think we've definitely got to win in Game 6 and come out and set our feet in the cement, so to speak, and establish something early and stay with that.",
"My presence on the floor has to be there night in, night out. I've got to be smart. Playing a good player like Pau, man, I'm competitive.",
"When I see a chance and opportunities to get the ball, I try to do that. But tonight wasn't that night.",
The focus was to win this game and deal with everything else later.,
"The first part of your question was rhythm. I thought I should have attacked more obviously with the schemes and stuff, patience, but I thought Paul had a great game tonight.",
"We still had opportunities to win this game, period. I make the two free throws, that's tied up, and who knows what it is. ",
"But there was a different scenario tonight, and the Lakers were a better team tonight.",
"I guess I'm just so upset with my play, that's all, because defensively I know I'm more sound than that.",
"For whatever reason, it was what it was. I'm not going to sit up here and bitch and moan about how I played in the game.",
"At the same time, I know my presence on the court has to be there for us to be a dominant team, even though we have guys out there that can get it done. I have to be on the court.",
"When it comes to reviewing my play tonight, I really felt like it was garbage.",
I really felt like I was selfish and being competitive one-on-one with Pau in the match-up instead of actually taking a breath and taking a step back and playing defense from a more sound and mental standpoint.,
"Like you said, I'm not perfect, I'll try to get better and try to apply the things I didn't do tonight to the next game.",
The focus is to win the next game. I haven't even thought about the other things.,
I just want to play better and put more of a stamp on the game and more of a presence on the game. That's really what the focus is for me right now.,
"It's going to be -- you know what it is. It's going to be like coming into the amazon, into the jungle. I look forward to going home and playing.",
"I always leave it on the court. You know, that's just something I owe to my ballclub, franchise every time I step on the court.",
"And I have plenty in the tank. It's not over. I've got to suck it up for two more games, if that. It'll all be worth it in the end.",
"Tough loss tonight, tough one to swallow, but hey, we'll try to get the next one in Boston.",
"I don't know, I just wanted to be aggressive and attack.",
"I notice when I'm aggressive, everybody else is aggressive, so I just wanted to make plays, feel like I have an advantage night in and night out.",
"That's all I do, try to get to the rim and take advantage of my opportunities.",
"He's a guy who can beat you all by himself, so the whole game plan is surrounding on stopping him and making other guys beat us.",
It's just unfortunate that we let the other guys beat us today.,
"It definitely hurts, tough one to swallow, and we'll just try to get the next one at home.",
"I don't think so. I thought it was great defense. That's all it was, it was good defense.",
"I wouldn't ask the refs for a call down the stretch. You let the players decide the game, and I thought that's what happened.",
We feel that way. We've just got to get off to better starts.,
"We don't thrive on that, letting a team get ahead and expecting to get back in the game. That's not something we practice.",
"But definitely, hey, we're up one game with two games to go at home, so it still feels like we have the advantage in the series, and I do feel like we're the better team.",
"Well, I felt great today actually. I felt great in warm-up, about as good as I've felt all season, the knee was pretty loose, I didn't have any problems with it.",
"Hey, if that's what it takes, that's what it's going to take. At this point in the season I'll do whatever I've got to do for my ballclub to win.",
"They out-rebounded us, I believe. The front line played well tonight, so that does show that we weren't the physical team tonight. But I know we'll bounce back.",
"I really don't think about it. We'll get a nice flight home tomorrow, finally get in in the evening and just try to stay on my schedule, try to eat when we get in and go to bed at a good time and just try to stay on schedule. That's all you can do.",
"The process of this and the journey of it is second to none. I said it after we lost the first one, obviously didn't want to lose any games, but coming back into the film session, getting together as a team and talking everything out, that's part of it too.",
"So once you start enjoying that and having fun with that, then good things happen for our team and we have responded well all season.",
"Honestly it's communication. We all have the same goal in this locker room, that's to win basketball games. So when we don't do that we look at what we did wrong, or when we win basketball games we do the same thing.",
"We don't want to spend the whole game fighting uphill, so just come out with a sense of urgency and be ready to go.",
"This team is just made up of toughness, all across the roster. We're going to give it everything we got and we'll live with the results.",
I'm not sure. I think we do just that. We thrive in this moment. We come together even more so in these moments.,
"I do. And it's the honest truth. It's a fact. But I can't worry about that. It comes with the job, I guess. But it is what it is. I still try to go and dominate, whether I'm shooting the ball well or not shooting the ball well.",
What I can do is do everything else. And so it is what it is. They can judge me on what they want to.,
That part don't matter to me. I'm going to go out there and hoop and give it everything I got.,
"Yeah, it was tough, losing another player, another starter for us. Another big body for us that we need. It was tough. Big loss.",
"Keep saying it, Reg is one of the most positive people. He just keeps everything light. And that's what you need in these moments.",
"But I thought situations like that, you rally together and you just find a way.",
"It's just been tough. It's been a process. I hear LeBron say he's not 100 percent and won't ever be 100 percent again. I thought about it, like, man, that was stripped from me as well.",
"You just keep it moving. But it is tough, going through these injuries, rehabbing, finding a way to be yourself again.",
"But again, it's part of this game and you have to take it. You have to roll with it and you have to be able to adapt.",
"I think the good thing about it, you just learn on the fly. You learn how to adapt to stuff, knowing what you can and cannot do.",
And then you just figure out new ways to do things. I think that's what I've been able to do this year.,
I think that comes down to the mental part because athleticism goes and you pick up tricks on kind of how to do these things you used to be able to do again.,
"Yeah, you never can predict how the game is going to go. But I thought the energy, the mood, was that we were going to come out and if they were going to finish this series off, they were going to have to work for it.",
"That was just the mentality we came into this with. We weren't going to back down. We weren't going to just throw in the towel. The fact of the matter is, they got to beat us.",
"It's one game for us, and it's one game for them. One game they beat us, we're out. One game, continue our season. So we just have that mentality to start the game off.",
