"They're dangerous. Obviously KD makes them a different team, they have been here before and that's probably a question you're going to have to ask them. I'm just focusing on our team and what we got to do next game.",
"At that time I felt that, like you said, he probably wanted to get us some rest at that moment. You never know, I mean, if we would have won the game, we wouldn't be talking about it.",
"Like what do I think about his situation? It's devastating. Like you said, you work so hard to get to this point, these are the last games, you see him try to come out and push himself, but obviously he tried to do a move -- and I feel bad for him.",
"I've been in that situation before. I hope he has a speedy recovery, and just gets healthy and I hope that he's going to be okay mentally, just throughout the whole rehab process. Because like I said before, we work so hard to either play in the Finals or just play in the NBA, and when you're not playing, it's hard to wrap your mind around it. But I'm pretty sure he's going to attack each day and get better and come back strong.",
"I mean, just try to come out and match that emotion and that drive. Come out and do the same thing, just be mentally focused, try to limit our mistakes, and be the aggressor. Just play hard 48 minutes and see what happens. Play confident.",
"I was just pretty much fight through adversity. It's not going to be easy, stay confident. We know we can win and that's it. I'm not going to say everything, but those are the main key points.",
I guess nerves probably settled down from there and we started to play a little better basketball. But we're going against a great team and they weren't going to quit.,
"We have been doing this for years, so it's natural. It's not that we think we have to take on the scoring load, but when Kevin's not out there we -- the ball's going to find us a little bit more because obviously you know what he can do, averaging 35 a game in this post-season run.
",
"Well, we have been down big before, we have been down fourth quarters, late in games, and Coach Kerr drew up a couple great sets and me and Steph just got clean looks and you don't want to give us too many of those because they will go in most of the time.",
We're not even thinking about scoring when you're on that side of the ball. You just got to take it one play at a time.,
"I don't think today showed it. If anyone watched the last three years of basketball, you saw this man was the Finals MVP back to back. So all that, those talking heads who say we're better without him, that's just ludicrous. Like that's crazy.",
"So we don't even pay any of that no mind because with him we are really one, I believe, one of the greatest teams to ever play. Without him we're a really good team, but it's you throw Kevin Durant out there, like I said before, one of the greatest ever.",
"So we don't pay that any attention because that's just stupid. Stupid. Because he's a warrior. You saw what he did tonight, he sacrificed his health for us and we dearly miss him. It was very deflating to see him go out. I'm just going to pray for the guy, and I know he'll be back even stronger.",
"Yeah, it felt great out of my hand. He got a piece of it, that's what great defenders do. He got a piece of it and we'll continue to look at it and see how we can be better for the next game.",
"In this league we're all brothers. At the end of the day, we're all brothers and it's a small brotherhood and you never want to see a competitor like him go down. You don't know what the circumstances are.",
"No, we stayed in the moment. They came back and made three straight threes. Played some good defense down the stretch. We just missed some shots and they did what they were supposed to do.",
"We don't know what's this or that. So I just kind of -- we don't want that type of stuff. And it didn't change much emotionally. It was just after he went down he went down, and we got on and finished the game",
But probably could have gotten a little bit better maybe but we got to look at it and see what we can get better at.,
"Man, I just asked if he was okay. That was it. And the emotions, I don't know what their emotions are down there, but like I say in this league it's a small brotherhood, and we don't want to ever see any of our fellow brothers go down.",
