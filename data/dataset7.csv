"They're dangerous. Obviously KD makes them a different team, they have been here before and that's probably a question you're going to have to ask them. I'm just focusing on our team and what we got to do next game.",
"At that time I felt that, like you said, he probably wanted to get us some rest at that moment. You never know, I mean, if we would have won the game, we wouldn't be talking about it.",
"Like what do I think about his situation? It's devastating. Like you said, you work so hard to get to this point, these are the last games, you see him try to come out and push himself, but obviously he tried to do a move -- and I feel bad for him.",
"I've been in that situation before. I hope he has a speedy recovery, and just gets healthy and I hope that he's going to be okay mentally, just throughout the whole rehab process. Because like I said before, we work so hard to either play in the Finals or just play in the NBA, and when you're not playing, it's hard to wrap your mind around it. But I'm pretty sure he's going to attack each day and get better and come back strong.",
"I mean, just try to come out and match that emotion and that drive. Come out and do the same thing, just be mentally focused, try to limit our mistakes, and be the aggressor. Just play hard 48 minutes and see what happens. Play confident.",
"I was just pretty much fight through adversity. It's not going to be easy, stay confident. We know we can win and that's it. I'm not going to say everything, but those are the main key points.",
I guess nerves probably settled down from there and we started to play a little better basketball. But we're going against a great team and they weren't going to quit.,
"We have been doing this for years, so it's natural. It's not that we think we have to take on the scoring load, but when Kevin's not out there we -- the ball's going to find us a little bit more because obviously you know what he can do, averaging 35 a game in this post-season run.
",
"Well, we have been down big before, we have been down fourth quarters, late in games, and Coach Kerr drew up a couple great sets and me and Steph just got clean looks and you don't want to give us too many of those because they will go in most of the time.",
We're not even thinking about scoring when you're on that side of the ball. You just got to take it one play at a time.,
"I don't think today showed it. If anyone watched the last three years of basketball, you saw this man was the Finals MVP back to back. So all that, those talking heads who say we're better without him, that's just ludicrous. Like that's crazy.",
"So we don't even pay any of that no mind because with him we are really one, I believe, one of the greatest teams to ever play. Without him we're a really good team, but it's you throw Kevin Durant out there, like I said before, one of the greatest ever.",
"So we don't pay that any attention because that's just stupid. Stupid. Because he's a warrior. You saw what he did tonight, he sacrificed his health for us and we dearly miss him. It was very deflating to see him go out. I'm just going to pray for the guy, and I know he'll be back even stronger.",
"Yeah, it felt great out of my hand. He got a piece of it, that's what great defenders do. He got a piece of it and we'll continue to look at it and see how we can be better for the next game.",
"In this league we're all brothers. At the end of the day, we're all brothers and it's a small brotherhood and you never want to see a competitor like him go down. You don't know what the circumstances are.",
"No, we stayed in the moment. They came back and made three straight threes. Played some good defense down the stretch. We just missed some shots and they did what they were supposed to do.",
"We don't know what's this or that. So I just kind of -- we don't want that type of stuff. And it didn't change much emotionally. It was just after he went down he went down, and we got on and finished the game",
But probably could have gotten a little bit better maybe but we got to look at it and see what we can get better at.,
"Man, I just asked if he was okay. That was it. And the emotions, I don't know what their emotions are down there, but like I say in this league it's a small brotherhood, and we don't want to ever see any of our fellow brothers go down.",
I thought we did really well against him. I thought he took shots outside his arsenal and he made shots. The shots he didn't make were shots that he doesn't usually get.,
All in all we were man up on him. We understand his tendencies and we will try to make things as difficult as possible try to make him make shots over time.,
"They gave themselves a bunch of opportunities. They continued to push, and for whatever reason they just outplayed us. There is no two ways about it.",
I thought we were really solid defensively. I thought we got some stops and they weren't hurting us as badly on the offensive glass.,
We led them to one shot and got out and were able to push it up the floor.,
We moved the ball really well. We had a good rhythm to our game in the second quarter and just had the ability to just jump out a little bit.,
I don't know if there is any one thing I can point to. We hit some shots got some layups. Just easy baskets.,
I don't think we had a whole lot of that in the second half which gave them an opportunity to get back in the game.,
"You can say it does, but honestly I think they just played better in that second half. They are a very physical ball club.",
They got a bunch of offensive rebounds. They just played better. They played better in the second half.,
"I don't know what it is. You can say it was jitters. You can say they had extra days off, maybe a little bit of rust.",
"But they played better in the second half and we didn't. We played good enough, though, by the way.",
We have had some struggles in the first quarter for whatever reason to get out of the gates. I don't know what the explanation is for it.,
But they got a couple-point lead and so much time left in the ball game. We are not worried about it.,
"We want to get a good shot, see the ball go to the hoop one time and go from there. Whatever, whether it was 7 or 9 or zero, whatever it was, I don't think there is anybody worried over there.",
"We continue to do the same stuff, continue to take the same shots and eventually things start going for us.",
"He played good tonight. He was very aggressive. I thought our pick-and-roll defense was very poor in the second half and he was playing with a lot of confidence, got his outside shot going, too, so he was playing aggressive.",
We need to try to slow him down in Game 2 and try to play a better pick-and-roll defense. We will be fine.,
"Fabricio was huge, he played with a lot of energy. He was always at the right place at the right time, made the great cuts when they tried to double team.",
"On the rebound he helped us, even if we got kind of dominating on the rebounds. Utah dominated us. Fabricio got big boards for us. In the Game 2, we need to try to control the boards.",
"Utah played a lot better in the second half, you know. They outplayed us in the second half and maybe we got a little bit tired, we can't use that as an excuse.",
"Utah played great in the second half. That's what we are going to see in Game 2. We need to measure that, measure the intensity.",
We had a first good half. Second half we didn't play that well.,
"We are always going to try to control the tempo and try to get the ball inside to Timmy and try to get some points, easy basket in the paint.",
"My opinion penetration, we need too control that. I think that will be huge and don't give them easy baskets.",
Especially Boozer. He is always great with dunkings and stuff like that. We need to control that.,
"Maybe it was a factor, you know, in the first half, you know, as the first time they got a lot of young guys so maybe it took a half for them to get used to it and get comfortable with the situation and so that's why I say in Game 2, you know, they are going to be ready.",
"The way they played in the second half, that's what we will see the whole series. We need to make sure we match that.",
"I don't remember. It is always -- every time there is a first time you will be a little bit nervous and you are going to, like, not be as aggressive.",
"You want to take your time. I kind of understand maybe, you know, Utah that's what happened in the first half.",
That's what I always try to do. Sometimes it doesn't work. But it happened I made a couple big shots and then I got confident.,
"So that's my role in this team, try to come in and produce right from the get-go. Today it just happened so I am glad for that.",
"We shot well. 13 for 26 three-pointers, that's huge for us. But a big key was Tony just getting to the paint and finding Brent, finding Bruce, Fin.",
So that is going to be always very important against them because they are a tough team.,
They always collapse the paint and they want to make you take tough threes or jumpers so we just make those shots. That's why we were so successful.,
"Of course we get a little worried. I think we have done -- we had done a great job to get that 17, 20-point lead, but they are just a tough team.",
"They are never going to just let it go. They are going to keep fighting, keep running, hitting and guarding you hard, blitzing and we just turned the ball over too much and they started making shots.",
"So it is the thing we've got to work on. We had 23 turnovers. Most of them were in the second half, so it is something we've really got to improve.",
"Utah is one of the toughest teams to beat on the road, and it shows that they haven't lost a game in the playoffs, I think, at home.",
So we don't have to get any -- we don't have to get overconfident. We've got to stay humble because we just got what was ours.,
"We've got to do even better now to go and try to get one in Utah. Hopefully we show the same approach, the same concentration.",
"And Utah now is a different team than years ago, they are really good in transition and playing up tempo. So we are getting more possessions. We are making shots, too.",
We were down at 17 at the half. We have to fix that problem if we are going to have a chance.,
They are just a great team. They take what the defense gives you. They can hurt you in so many ways.,
"Tonight it was from outside. I mean, they were even with us in points in the paint, it is not like they weren't getting those inside touches, those inside points.",
They just happened to be hitting tonight. That's how they are. You've got to pick your poison with the team and they make you pay in so many ways.,
You just got to be -- we got to come up and be defensive minded. We got to make sure we get stops because it is important for us.,
"I think we can take the fact we played well, just not well enough on the road. We proved we can score against this team.",
We haven't proved we can stop them yet. That's a little discouraging.,
"We know if we tighten up our defense a little bit more in Salt Lake, we should have a much better chance.",
"We just need a couple more guys to step up, give us a little bit more help and hopefully be a much better game in Salt Lake on Saturday.",
That's what he does. That's how he gets his points. We just have to be able to stop it.,
We haven't been disciplined to stop them. They put up 100-plus points.,
"You can't beat a team -- like I said last game, you can't get down to a team 20 points in the first half and expect to come back against a team like this. They make you pay in so many ways.",
We can take the fact that we came back and won that series. That's definitely a positive thing we can take back and we still have a chance.,
"The series is not over. I think we're -- it is a lot worse to be down 2-0 to the Spurs than it is to the Rockets because they are a better team, defensively, offensively.",
They have championships and the guys know how to win. They are also a much better road team. They play well on the road.,
"It will be tough for us to get these two victories, but that's what we have to do to even things back up and hopefully come back here 2-2.",
"Every time we started making a run, they made a 3. They made a big basket. Barry, Finley, stepped up and hit shots, Tony Parker in the fourth quarter.",
What he said basically is we have to play harder and come out with more determination.,
"It wasn't the same spiel as Game 1, dig deep and fight back. Don't give up.",
We tried to come back I don't know how many times. We cut it down to maybe seven or eight. You guys know better than I do,
"But it just seemed like right when we needed a stop, they got a layup, they got a three and the lead jumped right back up. Or we had a turnover or what have you.",
"You know, we did a good job of scoring when we had to score and we have to make the game more like two or three or have the lead or when we are down make it one or two possessions as opposed, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. You know what I mean? That's what we have to do.",
"It is definitely frustrating, especially because we're running ourselves -- when we started the second quarter, this is where they hurt us and we come out and do the same thing.",
"We come out and play even with them until about eight, seven minutes and it seems like they make a run.",
"A team like that can hurt you with runs because, like I said, they are so sound defensively.",
"They are going to get stops and they make you pay, whether it is inside with Tim Duncan or tonight with Bruce Bowen with threes.",
You have to keep playing and keep looking to be aggressive.,
"I think you get yourself in trouble when you start becoming passive or start kind of stepping away from, not necessarily the spotlight, but opportunities to take advantage of plays.",
"So, you know, against the Spurs, the opportunities and the looks and things, especially for me, have been kind of few and far between.",
I have had a harder time finding a rhythm. It has been a shot or two here and there.,
I have to try to establish a rhythm myself. I have to keep making sure I am playing the entire game and not just relying on shots to help the team.,
"Yeah, I definitely think that's a big part of it. But I think on top of that, you know, if we're not executing up to par, you know, as far as what we do on the offensive end, then it make it is more difficult for the guys who are kind of in and around Deron, Carlos, Mehmet be effective.",
It is more than a one-guy thing right now in terms of offensively not having enough fire power from enough different spots.,
"And a lot of that goes back to sharpening up our execution so that when other guys do get shots, they are good shots and you can step into them and knock them down with confidence.",
"Yeah, he hasn't really had to hammer it home much, I don't think. That is what his job is and we respect it, we understand it.",
"But it is no secret. I have said it both nights after the game. I mean, to let a team as good as the Spurs shoot in the mid 50s from the field, on their home court especially, you are going to have a tough time winning.",
"So, you know, our chances to win Saturday and win this series are going to be built on our defensive play.",
"That's how it was in the first two series, and it will be no different in this series or any team going forward.",
Defense wins championships and we are playing against a team that has been there before.,
"We have to get that understanding ourselves, no matter how many times the ball is going in and out of the hole offensively, defensively is where you get it done.",
"That's why they are the best basketball players in the world. I think it is not really that, I think it is more so collectively as a team making it hard for them to operate in the space they are operating in, the way they are doing us.",
