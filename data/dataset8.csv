Quote,Aura Points
"Literally for everybody. Mikey, he had three surgeries and still came here and helped us win a championship. Jamal, who had surgery and didn't play well at the beginning of the season, like I told you guys, but we all know what he's capable of.",
"It's good. It's good. We did a job. I think we played the best basketball I'm not going to say in the postseason, but I think we were there playing the best basketball. Today we didn't make shots, but still, we defend.",
"I think it's a great journey. Like you said, 41st pick, but that doesn't matter. When you're here, you're a player. They have a couple guys that weren't even drafted and they're still playing and contributing to them to win.",
"I didn't know that. That's great. But to be honest, I don't think about the next year. I'm going to ask the coach to give me a couple weeks more off so I can be ready for the season.",
"Yes, but we have -- it's not the starting unit. It's the whole team. Since day one in San Diego, it was something different about this team. I felt it. I felt some different energy and every day since then I had the same feeling. I'm not really optimistic guy, but that gave me hope that we can do something.",
"Yes, the core, but if you want to be a success, you need a couple years. You need to be bad, then you need to be good, then when you're good you need to fail, and then when you fail, you're going to figure it out.",
I think experience is something that is not what happened to you. It's what you're going to do with what happened to you.,
"Yes, Jamal was injured. Yes, we lose the first round or second round in the Playoffs. I don't even remember. Who remembers. But there is a process that you need to -- there is steps that you need to fill, and there is no shortcuts. It's a journey, and I'm glad that I'm part of the journey.",
"Well, we have been down big before, we have been down fourth quarters, late in games, and Coach Kerr drew up a couple great sets and me and Steph just got clean looks and you don't want to give us too many of those because they will go in most of the time.",
"I mean, we succeed in our jobs, and we won the whole thing. It's an amazing feeling. But like I said before, it's not everything in the world. I think. Okay, I won it. Okay, not I, we won it. But I think it's not the most important thing in the world still.",
"In that situation, emotions, yes, I yell at them, but I think they're used to it. Sometimes I yell at them, sometimes I cheer them but that's part of the family, part of the team.",
"Everything was hitting. Everything was hitting at once, from the journey, to the celebration with the guys, to enjoying the moment, to looking back on the rehab, to looking back at myself as a kid, as the other viewer, looking from the crowd in or from the camera lens in, and now looking back at them.",
"Every real hooper wants to be on this stage and play in the game and be in this moment. To see it full circle, going from my rehab, not being able to walk, go up the stairs, not just for a month or two. It was for a long time. A lot of different things going through my head. A lot of tears. A lot of blood, sweat and tears, and real ones.",
"Like I said, just to see it full circle and have total belief in myself, have the team have total belief in me, people back home have total belief in me, that's all I could ever ask for, and just to see it like this is amazing.",
"But like I said, that adrenaline kicks in, and you want to do something so bad. That's why I was ready to go at halftime, calm down and reset myself and do whatever the team needs me to do to get the win.",
"I always say, if you go back to the first game in Utah, I picked up the ball in the paint like five times. I could count. I was so lost. I had never felt being that lost on the court before. I just didn't want to go in the paint or jump or land or feel contact. Just how far I've come from that moment.",
"I didn't shoot well early, Jok didn't score early, a couple calls didn't go our way, and Mike, we just told him, this is your night. No matter what happens, this is your night. We tried to make an effort to get him going, and he took advantage of it.",
"I got on him sometime during the season like hey, we're not your little kids anymore. We're grown men, and if we make a mistake just come talk to us. Just come talk to us.",
"Yeah, the best word for me to say is unselfish and having trust in each other. The biggest thing is when we give each other space to work, we allow the defense to make mistakes or our reads to happen.",
"I have to say that I had my doubts, as well. It's just natural. Somebody asked me about butterflies. That's what makes you alive. That's what makes you care. When you doubt yourself, that's what makes you try to find a way to turn it around.",
"It was. You play the game and you haven't seen it, and you're like, man, that was an ugly game. Then you look at the tape and you're like, maybe it wasn't that bad. But that game, it really was that bad, you know what I'm saying, for us.",
"We executed, and my performance taking care of the ball and trying to set the table, it was pretty bad. But we came out with the win, and that's all really that matters.",
"Well, that's really not me. I've had a lot of games where I've taken less than ten shots, you know what I'm saying, but when I do do that, we've got at least three guys rolling.",
"Last night we only had one guy, Rip, who pretty much carried us. You probably won't see that too often.",
"He told me, settle down, relax, make the play, don't worry about it. We're there for one another like that, especially when one of us is struggling, the other one is always there to have his back. That's why we're such a great tandem.",
"No, they usually showed real hard, but they never really trapped it hard. No matter what pick-and-roll we was running, it was high side, low, it didn't matter, they were just trying to take me away. I really don't blame them. But it won't be that effective anymore, I know that.",
"Good teams win ugly games, man. Just find a way. You've just got to find a way sometimes, and that's exactly what we did yesterday.",
"I thought our second half was pretty good, considering how bad the first half was. It was pretty good. We came out, turned the tide once again in the second half.",
"Once we finally took the lead, we never looked back.",
"Yeah, we planned on him being a lot more aggressive, and because he wasn't, a lot of the things that we planned on doing or talked about, we didn't even have to go to them as far as defending him.",
"So I'm sure we'll have the opportunity the next game. He's going to be very aggressive, they're talking about having him shoot free throws and all of that. I'm sure he'll find a way to get on that free-throw line the next game. It doesn't really matter, we've just got to play.",
"I thought it was a great play. I thought it was a great play. It was horrible defense by us, but it was a great play.",
"It's been an ugly game, and you've got one of your best three-point shooters wide open. He just had six or seven in the last game. So I thought it was an excellent play. I think everybody just -- they want him to be the man so bad and want him to shoot every single time, and that's just unfair.",
"The kid made a great, great play. If they would have made that shot, then they would have been talking about how wonderful the play was. I'm just glad they missed it.",
"I think a lot of that is going to be on me, like the pick-and-rolls and the trap, you know what I'm saying, getting some early throw-backs, trying to get them going, just on pick-and-rolls and stuff like that.",
"They played behind in the post, throw it in, let them go a little bit. We'll find out. They'll be fine.",
"Yeah, that was. That was exciting. We scored, they scored, one big play after another. Both teams, really. That was a lot of fun. I'm just glad we came out on top.",
" It did, it did. Obviously we don't shoot for games in the 70s, but it's like that sometimes, you know what I'm saying? That's the one thing I love about our team is we can love the games in the 70s and 80s and we can win in the 100s.",
We're versatile that way. You've just got to stay aggressive.,
"I don't think so. I don't think so. I think we'll see a better effort probably on both sides, both teams. I think it's going to be a battle.",
"Oh, yeah, definitely like a heavyweight fight. We had a lot of opportunities to make shots. We turned the ball over too many times. You know, we didn't play our best.",
"We played uncharacteristic at times, but for the most part we defended, you know, and when you do that, good things will happen.",
I'll take it as a gain that we won on defense. I'll take it.,
"Like I said, he made a great move to the basket. I think that was one of them plays that was drawn up. We knew going into time-out that they was going to come back with Donyell and to watch him for a three-point shot.",
"We kind of almost let one get away because that's the last thing we wanted to do is give Donyell a wide-open shot, but he made the pass that he was supposed to make.",
"So now we've just got to make quick decisions. We've just got to know that. That's something we didn't know come into the game, but now we do.",
"Well, like I said, we came out kind of slow, you know. I knew if the game was close, I liked our chances. So I think we never had a bigger lead than four or five points the whole game, but we just stayed with him.",
"You know, we defended, took our time down the stretch and got the win.",
" I mean, we've just got to be a lot more in tune. We've got to be a lot more in tune. We've got to come out ready to get into the game.",
"You've got to come out with a spark right from the beginning because they're not going to give us one. In order for us to get to where we want to get to, we've got to come out and play hard from the beginning.",
"I don't think he's frustrated at all. We won. We've got guys on this team, as long as we win, everything is all good.",
"We've just got to go out there and just worry about ourselves. We can continue to control the tempo and play the way we want to play, we should be okay.",
"Well, we just know if we don't have a big lead, as long as the game is close, we feel good, we feel comfortable.",
"As long as you come down to the fourth quarter, you've got to defend, we've got to execute our offense, we've all got to be on the same page. We're always in tune, so that's a good thing.",
"I mean, like I said, it's hard to go out and move without the ball, any time, regardless of what you do or what type of containment and stuff like that, and I knew that coming into the second half. What I tried to do was try to make plays for Chauncey, try to make plays for C-Webb, give them dumb-downs and things like that, try to get the guys going.",
" I think him being a little too anxious. You want to win so much, and Flip always tells us that that over-aggressive energy, we've got to slow down a little bit.",
"I think when we played Chicago, we blocked it, they didn't really trap. So this is the first time -- in the playoffs they started trapping pick-and-roll, so now we've just got to do a better job of peppering the ball.",
"I'm like -- I'll go out there, ""I'm anxious, too anxious,"" he's yelling and screaming at me, and last night I was doing the same thing to him.",
"Just slow down. I think that's our biggest thing with me and him. You know, when I come out there and I'm running around like crazy, ""Slow down, Rip. Slow down, Rip,"" and vice versa.",
"I think that's the great relationship we have. We can see things out there that if one of us don't see it. Like I said, this is the first time their team started trapping pick-and-rolls, so now we've just got to adjust.",
"It was definitely a physical game tonight. You know, fouls were called at times and weren't called at times. You know, this is what it's about.",
"You know, you can't look to get fouls and you've got to try to be as aggressive as possible.",
"No, I go for the winning play. If two guys come at you and your teammate is open, then give it up. Simple as that.",
"No, you've just got to take what's there. It's not about taking a high volume of shots, it's about trying to win the basketball game.",
You've got to take what's there. We had an opportunity to me with me taking three shots in the fourth quarter.,
We game is not solely on taking a lot of shots. I'm going to continue to say that. That's the only answer I can give you. We had an opportunity to win.,
"We definitely played pretty well. Both teams are going to make adjustments, you just do that in the playoffs. But as a whole we played pretty well. You can't ask for nothing more than what we did tonight.",
"We always want to win the ballgame, but we always say if we play as hard as we did tonight for 48 minutes, like we did, we're not satisfied but we can look back and say, okay, we're okay with this loss tonight.",
Not sure. It's just something that we've got to work on and get better at. At times we look to take too many jump shots to start the third quarter instead of attacking.,
"Definitely with a team like Detroit that's very efficient on the offensive end, we've got to know how to pick your poison at times, and if there's a jump shot that's open, take your shot.",
"They played great. I mean, their defensive mindset is very good. But for me, I just -- you just take what's there.",
"You know, if you get a good look at it, you go for it. If not you kick it to a teammate. Simple as that.",
We're not focused on them. We're focused on ourselves. They've got to do what they've got to do to try to get the win.,
We're focused on ourselves. We're not worried about them trying to make any adjustments.,
"We're just going to go out there and just play, throw the ball up.",
"Same approach I took last game, you know, don't give them no easy shots, try to make things hard for them and block out.",
"You know, simple basketball. It's nothing fancy, nothing new.",
"It's a positive that we won, but it's a negative because we didn't feel like we won, you know, so that's just the way that we feel, the aura that's in our locker room.",
"No, it wasn't a matter of shutting it down. He still can get a shot up. Sometimes there's two people on him or three people on him depending on where he's at on the floor.",
"Well, we have a lot of guys. There's hired assassins on this team. We shoot well, concerning the bigs, myself.",
"I'm not worried about the way they've been shooting for the last few games because I know that at any given moment they can get out of their slump, it's just a matter of putting shots up.",
"I don't know. I don't know. We got the win, and that's most important. I don't know. I'm really not concerned with that.",
"It's a little bit different, but I mean, each series is different, so we really just play as the series comes.",
We're just trying to make sure that I do whatever I can when I'm in there to get a win.,
"Still played pretty good besides that, so hopefully I don't get in foul trouble this game and stay in there a little longer.",
"Really we just have to make an effort, watch film, and realize where our gaps are. We have to realize -- keep them off the glass.",
"Just mentally prepare for it than anything physically, just looking at film and seeing what we can take advantage of it.",
"Doesn't matter. You know, it's going to get to every other day pretty soon, so playing ball, you play two games in the same day in tournaments, so any day of rest is good. But it really doesn't matter, one or two days.",
"You know, I'm really trying not to think about it. I've been to the Western Conference Finals before, and I know it doesn't help to think about the future.",
"You've got to take care of now. I know I'm close, but, you know, you've got to get there. Being close doesn't matter.",
"The style of play -- I think the Western because you run a lot more, you really don't get tired in these games because of timeouts and the way we play our style.",
"So the Western Conference was a little faster paced. But here it's a lot more physical, so they both have disadvantages.",
"Just, you know, there is no excuse not to. You just have to -- obviously being at home, that's another important step. The crowd and atmosphere are behind you. You've got to come out with a lot of energy and aggressiveness.",
"Our team, whatever we put together, it's for a short period of time, so obviously the thing is try to get a great group of guys, the best fit players around that can gel together as quickly as possible and see what happens that way.",
"Like I said, last year was the toughest I think of the three-year commitment as far as from my perspective because of what I had to do.",
"it kind of takes the air out of your defense a little bit and kind of gets you off to a start that you don't want. You've just got to box out, be aggressive on both ends and see how things go from there.",
Obviously we're going to try to be aggressive and get the ball out of his hands and try to make other guys make plays.,
"You know, we'll see how things go in Game 2. Chauncey, keep making the right decisions, keep being aggressive off the screens and we can start to do those things.",
"I think we'll find of figure out the double-teams a little bit, but if I have to handle the ball a little bit more, obviously I'm willing to do that.",
"Just for the other four players on our team to be in the right position at the right time because, you know, my job is to keep him in front of me at all times and their job is to help when I'm -- when he gets me off the dribble.",
Their job is harder than mine.,
"Obviously from my angle, me guarding him, I couldn't see who was open. But looking at the replay, obviously it was the right play.",
