"It's a surreal feeling. Still has not really kicked in yet. Just trying, I guess, to enjoy the moment. I kept saying, ""Wow."" These last seven years have been a roller coaster, up and down. I had to listen to all the s--- that people said about me, and tonight, it was worth it. Oh, my God.",
"I mean, maybe getting drafted. That's something that you dream about. But this is at the top of the mountain. To be able to say we did it, that we came together and we won a championship. Banner No. 18 has been hanging over our head for so many years. To know that we're going to be engraved in history, and it still hasn't like registered. I'm just still trying to process it all. But we did it. We won a championship.",
"He told me that I was the best in the world. I said, ""You're damn right I am.""",
"That it was -- it was -- all the sacrifice was worth it. I'm so thankful to have been in the positions that I was growing up. Thankful for my mom. Thankful for my dad introducing me to basketball. My grandmother who helped raise me. All my friends and family that have supported me, every coach, every teammate that I've had. There's a lot of people that have had a hand in the success of Jayson Tatum. So I guess in this moment, I'm just very thankful for everybody that supported me in the highest of moments and in the lowest of moments. I'm very, very appreciative of that.",
"I mean, this is going to be a night that I will remember for the rest of my life, from the game, the celebration, these moments. You know, over the last couple years, we had some tough losses at home in the playoffs. We've lost the NBA Championship at home in front of our fans. We had a chance to beat Miami in Game 6 a few years ago and lost that one. So to have a big win, the biggest win that you could have in front of your home crowd, I felt like that was really important to go out there and do everything in my power to make sure we won this game tonight.",
"It took being relentless. It took being on the other side of this and losing in the Finals and being at literally the lowest point in a basketball career that you could be, to next year, to the following year, thinking that was going to be the time, and come up short again. So, I mean, people have said it before. But coming up short and having failures makes this moment that much better. Because you know what it feels like to lose. You know what it feels like to be on the other side of this and be in the locker room and hearing the other team celebrating, hearing them celebrate on your home floor. That was devastating. And now, to elevate yourself in a space that, you know, all your favorite players are in, everybody that they consider greats or legends have won a championship, and all of the guys I looked up to won a championship, multiple championships. So now I can, like, walk in those rooms and be a part of that. It's a hell of a feeling. This is more -- I dreamed about what it would be like, but this is 10 times better.",
"First of all, congrats to him. Well-deserved. Extremely happy for him. This is a hell of an accomplishment. The main goal for us was to win a championship. We weren't -- we didn't care who got Finals MVP. I know that I need him through this journey and he needs me. So, you know, it was great to see him have that moment and share that moment with him. I'm extremely happy for him. Well-deserved. That was big-time. He earned that.",
"No, just some missed shots. It's part of the game. It'll get better. But missed shots, made shots, we've just got to win because then nobody is paying attention to it. Which we will do. I will be better because whenever I'm better, we are better as a whole.",
"A lot of good. Obviously, he is one of the greatest players to play that beautiful game. I'm so excited for the city of Miami, to be able to have a player of that caliber here. I'm excited for the city of Miami in so many different ways. Obviously us being in the Finals and having an opportunity to do something special.
Now that he is here, I think all the football/soccer fans from all over the world are going to come here and get an opportunity to watch him compete. I'm glad he is here.",
"I grade it 10 out of 10. Nobody on my team can afford it, so they don't want to go there and pay for it.",
"It was very important. Yes, I did grow as a player, but I grew as like a person/leader because I just always remember the things he told me more often than anything is everybody doesn't go about things the way that you go about it. But there is an organization out there that does, that being this one. He just told me everything that the Heat are about was about winning, and he wasn't doing anything that he wasn't supposed to be doing. I'm just saying he had been a legend here, still is, and he was just saying the reason he was who he was was because of the way that they went about things here, and he pointed me in this direction.",
"Obviously, I expect to win. But what makes me proud is these guys are never out of the fight. They're so joyful because we're in this thing together through good and through bad. I'm proud of my guys for that. I love my guys for that. Tomorrow we're going to come out with a lot more energy. We're going to compete at a high level. We're going to get one at home.",
"I mean, obviously he has been huge in what we have done all year long. But I think his spirits are really high. He is doing everything that he can to come back and help. I don't know where he is in that process, but I see him working. I see him smiling. I see him being around the guys, which is good for him and even better for us. We want him out there competing with us. We always have. We always will. But whenever he is ready, he'll be back, and he will be better than ever.",
"Honestly, I can't even tell you the answer to it because he can shoot the ball, put the ball on the floor, pass the ball. You've just got to do everything you can to stay between him and the basket, trace the ball with both hands. But he is a hell of a player. He has been very, very dominant everywhere on the floor. You're closing out one of the best players if not the best player in the world. It's a handful for anybody that is closing him out.",
"I wouldn't say that I know him enough, but I have met him before. Will I reach out? Probably not. I know he has probably got a ton of stuff going on anyway. He is coming over here to do something special for this city. I won't reach out. I'm happy that he is here, though. I really am. I know we will link whenever he is here.",
"I mean, he gets me open a lot of the times. Then obviously you have to guard him whenever he is rolling, popping. Then when they get him the ball, he is getting the ball to everybody else and/or finishing or getting to the free-throw line. He has been excellent throughout this entire playoff run, throughout the entire series and throughout the entire season. We need him to continually set screens, get out in transition and do everything that he has been doing to help us win.",
"Keep doing what I'm doing. Look to find my guys open on the perimeter, maybe dribble on the perimeter for some handoffs. Honestly, I can't tell you. I don't know. I've got to go back and watch it. But I know I'm going to find my guys. I have to find my guys if we want to win. So keep attacking and get the ball to my guys so they can get shots on goal.",
"Being calm, not rattled, is like the best thing ever, knowing that everything is going to be okay, everything is going to be just fine. As long as you give it your all, you go into it every day knowing that you have an opportunity to do something special. That is what we're doing here. We're having a lot of fun being and competing with one another. That is what we do. Stay calm, stay collected and go out there and do everything together.",
"I don't think it does too much. I just think you have some really talented basketball players on the roster. You have some really genius coaches on the coaching staff and some super genius individuals in the front office. They get everybody on the same page. They get everybody chasing the same goal. They get everybody to give in to the team, let go of the self and really buy into what we're doing here as a whole. Underdog or not, that's just what it is here, and we love it.",
"I wouldn't change anything. Not one thing. I continue to be who I am. We will continue to be who we are as a group, as a team. We're going to go out here and compete together. We're going to win together. We're going to be who we are. I wouldn't change a thing, though.",
"It was good. Puerto Rican food, I'm a big foodie, so any opportunity I get to go be around the city, enjoy food, enjoy really good company with people I don't get to see every day, I'm fortunate to do that. I've got a lot of love for all types of food, but for sure all the food around Miami.",
