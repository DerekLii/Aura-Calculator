"It's a surreal feeling. Still has not really kicked in yet. Just trying, I guess, to enjoy the moment. I kept saying, 'Wow.' ",
"I mean, maybe getting drafted. That's something that you dream about. But this is at the top of the mountain. To be able to say we did it, that we came together and we won a championship. Banner No. 18 has been hanging over our head for so many years. To know that we're going to be engraved in history, and it still hasn't like registered. I'm just still trying to process it all. But we did it. We won a championship.",
"He told me that I was the best in the world. I said, ""You're damn right I am.""",
"That it was -- it was -- all the sacrifice was worth it. I'm so thankful to have been in the positions that I was growing up. Thankful for my mom. Thankful for my dad introducing me to basketball. My grandmother who helped raise me. All my friends and family that have supported me, every coach, every teammate that I've had.",
"I mean, this is going to be a night that I will remember for the rest of my life, from the game, the celebration, these moments. You know, over the last couple years, we had some tough losses at home in the playoffs. We've lost the NBA Championship at home in front of our fans. We had a chance to beat Miami in Game 6 a few years ago and lost that one. So to have a big win, the biggest win that you could have in front of your home crowd, I felt like that was really important to go out there and do everything in my power to make sure we won this game tonight.",
"It took being relentless. It took being on the other side of this and losing in the Finals and being at literally the lowest point in a basketball career that you could be, to next year, to the following year, thinking that was going to be the time, and come up short again. So, I mean, people have said it before. But coming up short and having failures makes this moment that much better. Because you know what it feels like to lose.  So now I can, like, walk in those rooms and be a part of that. It's a hell of a feeling. This is more -- I dreamed about what it would be like, but this is 10 times better.",
"First of all, congrats to him. Well-deserved. Extremely happy for him. This is a hell of an accomplishment. The main goal for us was to win a championship. We weren't -- we didn't care who got Finals MVP. I know that I need him through this journey and he needs me. So, you know, it was great to see him have that moment and share that moment with him. I'm extremely happy for him. Well-deserved. That was big-time. He earned that.",
"A lot of good. Obviously, he is one of the greatest players to play that beautiful game. I'm so excited for the city of Miami, to be able to have a player of that caliber here. I'm excited for the city of Miami in so many different ways.",
"I grade it 10 out of 10. Nobody on my team can afford it, so they don't want to go there and pay for it.",
"It was very important. Yes, I did grow as a player, but I grew as like a person/leader because I just always remember the things he told me more often than anything is everybody doesn't go about things the way that you go about it. But there is an organization out there that does, that being this one.",
"Obviously, I expect to win. But what makes me proud is these guys are never out of the fight. They're so joyful because we're in this thing together through good and through bad. I'm proud of my guys for that.",
"I mean, obviously he has been huge in what we have done all year long. But I think his spirits are really high. He is doing everything that he can to come back and help. I don't know where he is in that process, but I see him working. I see him smiling. I see him being around the guys, which is good for him and even better for us. We want him out there competing with us. We always have. We always will. But whenever he is ready, he'll be back, and he will be better than ever.",
"Honestly, I can't even tell you the answer to it because he can shoot the ball, put the ball on the floor, pass the ball. You've just got to do everything you can to stay between him and the basket, trace the ball with both hands. But he is a hell of a player. He has been very, very dominant everywhere on the floor. You're closing out one of the best players if not the best player in the world. It's a handful for anybody that is closing him out.",
"I wouldn't say that I know him enough, but I have met him before. Will I reach out? Probably not. I know he has probably got a ton of stuff going on anyway. He is coming over here to do something special for this city. I won't reach out. I'm happy that he is here, though. I really am. I know we will link whenever he is here.",
"I mean, he gets me open a lot of the times. Then obviously you have to guard him whenever he is rolling, popping. Then when they get him the ball, he is getting the ball to everybody else and/or finishing or getting to the free-throw line. He has been excellent throughout this entire playoff run, throughout the entire series and throughout the entire season. We need him to continually set screens, get out in transition and do everything that he has been doing to help us win.",
"Keep doing what I'm doing. Look to find my guys open on the perimeter, maybe dribble on the perimeter for some handoffs. Honestly, I can't tell you. I don't know. I've got to go back and watch it.",
"Being calm, not rattled, is like the best thing ever, knowing that everything is going to be okay, everything is going to be just fine.  ",
I don't think it does too much. I just think you have some really talented basketball players on the roster. You have some really genius coaches on the coaching staff and some super genius individuals in the front office.,
I wouldn't change anything. Not one thing. I continue to be who I am. ,
"It was good. Puerto Rican food, I'm a big foodie, so any opportunity I get to go be around the city, enjoy food, enjoy really good company with people I don't get to see every day, I'm fortunate to do that. I've got a lot of love for all types of food, but for sure all the food around Miami.",
"These last seven years have been a roller coaster, up and down. I had to listen to all the s--- that people said about me, and tonight, it was worth it. Oh, my God.",
"We will continue to be who we are as a group, as a team. We're going to go out here and compete together. We're going to win together. We're going to be who we are. I wouldn't change a thing, though.",
"As long as you give it your all, you go into it every day knowing that you have an opportunity to do something special. That is what we're doing here.",
"We're having a lot of fun being and competing with one another. That is what we do. Stay calm, stay collected and go out there and do everything together.",
But I know I'm going to find my guys. I have to find my guys if we want to win. So keep attacking and get the ball to my guys so they can get shots on goal.,
I love my guys for that. Tomorrow we're going to come out with a lot more energy. We're going to compete at a high level. We're going to get one at home.,
" Obviously us being in the Finals and having an opportunity to do something special.
Now that he is here, I think all the football/soccer fans from all over the world are going to come here and get an opportunity to watch him compete. I'm glad he is here.",
"You know what it feels like to be on the other side of this and be in the locker room and hearing the other team celebrating, hearing them celebrate on your home floor. That was devastating. And now, to elevate yourself in a space that, you know, all your favorite players are in, everybody that they consider greats or legends have won a championship, and all of the guys I looked up to won a championship, multiple championships.",
"He just told me everything that the Heat are about was about winning, and he wasn't doing anything that he wasn't supposed to be doing. I'm just saying he had been a legend here, still is, and he was just saying the reason he was who he was was because of the way that they went about things here, and he pointed me in this direction.",
"There's a lot of people that have had a hand in the success of Jayson Tatum. So I guess in this moment, I'm just very thankful for everybody that supported me in the highest of moments and in the lowest of moments. I'm very, very appreciative of that.",
"He's a competitor at the highest level and you understand that you're getting that. So, you have to be on your P's and Q's and I've been watching him in the previous series and who he's matched up with and he's guarding those primetime guys, so I'm sure I'll see him out there, but you have to be locked in when you're playing against him for sure.",
"What they think about the Suns? I mean, I think it's the baby here. It's the only professional team that has Phoenix in it. Every other team is Arizona. So, Phoenix Suns is the baby franchise here and they love it with a passion. I'm wearing the shirt from '93 right now.",
"Not really. I haven't been around too many people. I've just been in the house, for real. So, I've been laying low.",
"I used to try to bring him to the post every time he would switch on me. So, while you're walking down there to the post, he would be, like, I'm not going for that, I'm not going for that today. And we actually went back on an app that you can check every shot that you've matched up against somebody last year, and I scored on him a couple times, and he stopped me a couple times, so we just stopped that conversation, that narrative. But we also got into it the first day here when we had our first practice as a team, we were doing a three-on-three drill, and it's just, it's kind of the survival of the fittest mindset. I don't think it's really about the throw hands, but the closest thing you can do to that without doing it.",
"The attention to detail. And I feel it, too, ever since I got to the NBA. You watch games a different way than you did growing up. You're not watching it for entertainment anymore. You're scouting the whole time you're watching. So, it might be a simple play. Somebody might have scored on this possession over here. You sit back. You rewind it. Hey, look over here, do you see what they did over here? So, it's just viewing the game a different way, seeing the game a different way, and just understanding tendencies and communicating it out loud when you see it.",
"I mean, we're not here to justify what we're doing to anybody else, for real. I mean, we've had had goals for this group and aspirations for this group since day one. We keep those in-home for that reason.",
"He's always locked in, to be completely honest. I mean, I'm sure he might be feeling a different way in this first appearance here, but he's not going to show us no frantic movement or any nervousness.",
"That's where it all started. That's where it all started. Man, you threw me back thinking about it now. I'm reminiscing in my head right now. But that's where I fell in love with the game. I fell in love with that Pistons team. They taught me the game of basketball. And just being around everybody in West Michigan.",
"I haven't. I haven't thought about that. I think things would have been a little different. Obviously, I think you learn by living through experiences, and I would have lived a totally different lifestyle if I stayed in Michigan. But I love Michigan and I go back there in the summertime and I spend a lot of time out there. Me and my friends were just talking about it for like the 4th.",
"Yeah, I don't think it will hit me until it's all over. Even Western Conference champs, I mean, we're on this pursuit to do what we set out to do and we are here now. So, it's kind of hard to reflect on what you're doing when you're in the moment. So, our main focus right now is to win those four basketball games and that's pretty much it.",
"I mean, we have seen it a lot. I think that's what the NBA has went to. A lot of teams, especially trying to keep people out of their paint, will just switch 1 through 5, and everybody has to guard up. But you scout that. We scout that and we try to take advantage of that.",
"So excited. So excited. We have obviously had those matchups before in practice that have gotten heated at the highest level, but he's a competitor, and I have a lot of respect for that man, so we're going to be out there battling, for sure.",
"Yeah. Me and Tuck's was a lot worse than me and Chris's, so. Me and Chris, we talked a lot. Me and Tuck, we bumped into each other a little bit.",
"Yeah. We took a long road trip at the end of the season that even through that game I think we went like 3-2 on the road trip. It was five games, it was like Philly, Boston -- I forgot -- it was a loaded lineup. And they were all competitive games and we were like, this is how it's going to be at some level. And then we experienced the Lakers series and we're like, I'm glad we went through that, I'm glad we had those two losses, because you learn so much in that time. ",
"And having gone through that, that experience, shaped us for the next series in Denver. And then seeing the Clippers and dropping two games to them also. So just understanding that it's a series and it's a long series and you're going to have to play, you're going to have to play hard, win, lose or draw.",
"Somebody said before the playoffs started like when you win a game you feel like you can't lose again, when you lose you feel like you can't win again. And that's the playoffs for real. People get too high, people get too low, you're hearing everybody talking from every different angle but you have to understand where you're trying to go and what we're trying to do.",
"Obviously you never want to lose, but the level of focus that we bring back into the arena and the gym the next day, it's not more talking about it, it's like a demeanor and an energy that you can feel throughout everybody.",
"I think the Clippers used that against us a lot also, and Deandre being able to use his size and his ability to get on the offensive glass and move whoever his mismatch is, helps out a lot also. And then just having dynamic guards with Chris, Mikal, Jae and having the floor spaced and just creating for each other. So, we're expecting to see that a bit.",
"We were like, Any other place you would rather be if you weren't in the Finals? And it would be on Lake Michigan probably. But Milwaukee's on the other side of it, so we'll be going up there soon.",
"I remember Drake Harris, just looking up to him every day and wanting to be him. But Michigan-Michigan State rivalry game, just all that, all those memories, all the stories, that's where I learned the fundamentals of the game, honestly. I always say I learned the fundamentals in Michigan, and then when I moved to Mississippi, it brought more of the dog out. So, it was a great balance for me and I credit Michigan for a lot of my success, especially Grand Rapids, my hometown.",
"So just the focus for everybody to be locked in from top to bottom, not just the guys that are getting major minutes right now, 1 through 15, 16, with the coaching staff, just locked in at all levels preparing for this opportunity right here.",
" I think he's prepared for this, and it's more of an I've been waiting this long, preparing for this moment right here, and it's right in front of us. So, he's not walking a different way. He's not talking different way. But there's an understanding between all of us on what time it is and what we have to accomplish.",
"We compete against each other and we're on the constant pursuit to get better every day. Even during the regular season a simple play might go by and we stress it, we stress that this can't happen. I know it doesn't matter right now, but later down the line it can come back and get you and we don't want that to happen.",
"We're not sitting there watching the game in silence. We're sitting there, like, they let him do that again? We have to take that away when we play them. So, it's just a whole other level of basketball and film study when you're with Chris.",
"I think it started around that time to when they developed that, you hear people talk about, I remember when I watched Charles [Barkley] and them, like, you hear those stories at all times, and seeing the passion in their eyes when they're telling the stories and even being at the bottom of the barrel for the past five years and them still showing up and showing love shows that same type of love that they have for this team.",
"They get everybody on the same page. They get everybody chasing the same goal. They get everybody to give in to the team, let go of the self and really buy into what we're doing here as a whole. Underdog or not, that's just what it is here, and we love it.",
"Basically just being the first man on defense. Making sure I'm a presence. Foul awareness as well. Always showing my hands and just matching his physicality. This is a guy whose motor is insane, and we just have to match it and compete. That's what it comes down to at the end of the day, just competing.",
"Definitely O-boards, I think I'm great at. Just attacking the glass and being relentless on the glass. Being the first man in transition. If he crashes, I'll probably be the first man on my end to probably get early seals, just to try to put some pressure on the rim to change the game up a little bit. Angles, just finding good angles on the way I set screens to get people open -- pin-downs, on-ball screens. Just ways to put pressure on him having two against one.",
"Walking into here, seeing Mr. Larry [the Larry O'Brien Trophy] on every poster. It gave me goose bumps. I don't know if I was a part of it or I'm just here to look around or I'm just here for the NBA. I do not feel like I'm a player right now, but I am.",
"Just being relentless, doing what I do best. Just being a presence on both ends. Defense is what gets me going. Getting a couple boards off the glass, getting outlets, getting other guys running a little bit, getting the butterflies out. That's what really gets us going, attacking early. That's what we're good at in transition, and we're good at defense as well.",
"I think it prepared a lot, but at the end of the day, this is the playoffs. Lord knows what they're going to throw at us. It was just mainly sticking to what we do, sticking to the script, not changing anything, but just being relentless, playing together, moving the ball and just attacking in transition as best as we can and making sure we clean up the glass on the defensive end.",
"I can say it feels like it's going fast a little bit. But I definitely feel every game, body hurting and all that. I feel every part of this, the physicality throughout the games and just the mental stamina you have to have in between games and the type of reps you have to put in. Days you have to remember to rest and not rest. So it's just stuff like that you have to keep in mind.",
"I don't even know. I could just say it's not easy winning in the NBA. The type of sacrifice you have to put in and the preparation before each game, you just have to be consistent with it. Just to have the organization and the group, a team like this to be on the same page is insane, and just going through that wasn't easy. It was a lot of adversity and a lot of trials and tribulations to get through where we are today.",
"I mean, what I do best is I enjoy the night and when I wake back up it's over; it's back to work. If I'm away, by the time I land, I'm done with the win. I'm done celebrating; it's back to work. That's the type of mindset the whole team has, to be honest. Like coach says, we don't get happy on the farm. The job's not done. I guess the the team hasn't been here in a while, but as a group we know we ain't done nothing yet, you know what I'm saying?",
"Most of our toughness is because of Jae. The dude is a dude who is all about sacrificing. He's the main part of just sharing the ball, and just whatever contributes to wins, you do it. He's the main guy of that. Just having the type of experience he has, dealing with guys like Giannis and AD, he helped me a lot. Telling me what they like to do and what they don't like and things they like to do when it comes to drawing fouls. Him stepping up to the plate as well. Getting on our butts a little bit and making us step up. You need a guy like that.",
"He's just always telling us to be prepared. From the get-go we had a meeting and he was just telling us -- he was just locked in on just telling us that the only thing is just consistency when it comes to things like this. It's not going to always go our way. It's not going to always look pretty, but consistency is what kicks in.",
"He just -- he's an All-Star. He has a lot of game. He's tough. You've just got to watch film and know his tendencies a little bit and make it tough for him. He can shoot it, which makes it tough because you've got to pick up a little bit higher, good handle, loves his mid-range game and can finish. So just kind of picking spots on him and trying to make it tough for him, but he's really talented. It's going to be tough.",
"You know that nobody's out here to be disrespectful or embarrass you. So, we all know that, so it's just kind of like we're on you because of what we want. We want to win, and I've got to get on you so you can be better so we all can be better. There's never no upset with each other. It's just tough love, and sometimes you might be mad because you're not playing at the level you want to play at, and you might get frustrated, but then when it's over, you kind of tap the person up and say, my fault for being mad. I was tripping. And we're like, You're good. We're all together.",
"So, we just stay together, and that's what we do.",
"Thank you. Me and C. Payne, we actually saw it together, so it was pretty funny. We were crying about it -- crying as in laughing, not actually tears.",
"Basketball moms are great. They do a lot. They're usually the ones with the cars packed as kids with all your friends in there to take you to the games and taking you to get food, taking you this and that. So, they're unbelievable, and they're there no matter what. They're there for long road trips. So, they're great, and I'm just happy that my mom is one of them great moms, and I'm just blessed.",
"Thank you. It's been a journey. It's been wild ever since draft night, and it's great. I'm happy I'm here. The bubble as well, just kind of not knowing, even with COVID, just the world and NBA, trying to find something to bring back the season and doing something like the bubble that never happened before. So just going there not knowing what was going to happen kind of seemed like AAU all over again, but you're older and professional. So, it was different but it was fun at the same time.",
"Give them credit, they played hard, they played like a desperate team.",
"Going 8-0 made it a little bit more fun and kind of built us as we got closer down there because we saw each other every day, and it got us to where we're at right now. Obviously, adding key players helped too, but I think just building connections as a team and getting close with the guys that were already here kind of made a stamp that we're a family. Then when a guy's coming in knowing they're coming here to win and join a family.",
"We always scout. We always scout for Giannis. Obviously, he's the head of the snake. If he does or does not play, we're going to be prepared. We know how really good he is, actually how great he is, and we've just got to prepare. If he plays or doesn't play, we're going to be fully prepared. We're going to be ready.",
"Yeah, great question. I would say Vin is one of the many guys that kind of epitomizes what this organization is about. I say that, obviously, everyone knows Vin's success as a basketball player, so he's able to speak to the experiences and the things that you have to go through, the adversity and how to deal with both success and failure on the court, and then what I would say people don't see as much is the insight that he's been willing to provide from an off-the-court standpoint, the things that he's gone through in his life that he helps us learn from and hopefully helps us make decisions based off of his experiences that would put us in a position to have success off the floor.",
"I think his openness and willingness to do that is what has been one of the coolest things that I've seen in my entire career in the NBA because you don't necessarily know what you're getting into when you get into the NBA, both from a basketball standpoint, but also from an off-the-floor standpoint. So, the past players, and especially ones like Vin who had so much success on the floor, their willingness to be open and honest about things that they went through and try to help that next generation of players learn and make decisions based off that is truly incredible.",
"For sure. He's just a guy that you enjoy being around. You can have conversations with him, like I said, about really anything. The stories he has from his playing days, the experiences that he's gone through, and more his just willingness to exude positivity and confidence into yourself is what's been most impressive for me.",
"After a minute and a half conversation during a timeout with him, you feel like you can go out there and dunk on somebody or make seven threes in a row, but having a conversation with him for 10 minutes off the floor after a game, you feel like you can go out and make a difference and have an impact in the community, which you could argue is more important than dunking on somebody during a game.",
"So, I think just that type of personality that he has and willingness to not just exude confidence, but to speak to the different things that you'll come in contact with and have to go through in the world kind of makes it such a family-like atmosphere, which is what I think the Bucks have done such a tremendous job at as an organization, and he's a really good example of it.",
"Yeah, definitely. I think all three of them are tremendous players. Two of them are really great point guards. One of them's one of the best point guards of all time.",
"Then just understanding the differences in the three different players. Obviously, Devin Booker being more of a two guard, more of -- obviously, height. He's a little bit taller than the other two. They all have success in different ways on the floor. So, it's really just about understanding what their comfort zone, the one, two, three moves that they're trying to get to most often, trying to make it as tough for those two, three moves as you can, and try to put them in a position to have to go to the counter moves, four, five, whatever it might be, in order to try to put ourselves in the best position to have the most success.",
"I'll tell you, it's just adversity, right? Overcoming adversity. I think, as an athlete in general, as a competitor, you're going to have success and failure, you're going to have to fight adversity at some time. I think not just this year, but going through it and seeing what it takes to win in the regular season versus the playoffs, to see how together you have to be, both on and off the court, to put yourself and your team in the best position to win. Then specifically this year, it hasn't been an easy journey, but we stuck together. We've had open, honest conversations. ",
"We're tried to make sure that we're putting ourselves in a position both on and off the floor to have success, and overcoming adversity throughout the playoffs is inevitable. It's inevitable over the first three rounds. It's going to be inevitable in the Finals.",
" I think some of the similarities are they're really crafty in utilizing their bodies and putting themselves in position to have success both from making shots and also from getting fouled. So, defending without fouling and making sure positionally you're in the right position to not get caught, whether it be via a ball fake, a rip through, an off-balance move, whatever it might be.",
"Remaining together and sticking together, I think has been basically the start of what the culture of the Bucks has been built on, and it's going to be something we have to continue to exude in order to have success the Finals.",
"You can't replace a player the caliber of Giannis -- two-time MVP, the things he does on a nightly basis on both sides of the ball, you can't replace it. But I would say, as a human being, it's even more impressive what he does, and what he's done since he's been injured, continuing to be vocal, if not even more vocal, pulling players aside individually, addressing the team collectively, making sure he's still present and more than a big part of what we're doing has instilled confidence in both individual players as well as the team in general.",
"Obviously, you're talking about a guy that puts up 30 points a night. You're talking about a guy that rebounds the basketball, passes the basketball, defends as well, if not better, than anybody else. You're not going to necessarily replace that with one guy or with one thing.",
"The way we've tried to make sure we've put our best foot forward to have his back while he's out is doing it together. Obviously, Khris, Jrue, Bobby, there's been a bunch of guys that have stepped up in his absence, but it's been a collective group effort. ",
"It's been playing together. It's been sharing the basketball. It's been defending as a team and gang rebounding and doing all of the little things that it takes to win a basketball game so that we can try to put ourselves in this position to get to the Finals to give Giannis some more time to get healthy because, without him, we wouldn't be here. The things that he does off the court -- we all see what he does on the court, but the things he does off the court are, in my opinion, even more impressive.",
"Just everything comes naturally when it comes to leading, I feel like, in an NBA locker room. It just came naturally. Probably my Boston days, I was thrown into that role of being a leader, and my leadership comes natural by just putting in the work and letting my work speak for itself first before I even say a word.",
"I just think it came naturally back in my Boston days, like four or five years into the NBA, and it just comes from the heart. It comes from wanting the best for my teammates and wanting to compete as a team at the highest level and put myself and my teammates in a position to do so. So, that's what it comes from.",
"Yeah, I definitely remember the road trip we took to Milwaukee, and that was a tough road trip for our team, but we prevailed, and we came out with a winning record. I definitely feel like those situations have prepared us for moments in this postseason, no doubt about it.",
"We were playing some tough teams, and obviously Milwaukee was one of the best Eastern Conference teams at the time, and we came out with a win on the road and in a tough environment. Those situations definitely motivated us as a team to come together and definitely know we can play high-level basketball either at home or on the road. So definitely gave us motivation and momentum.",
"Just probably being -- I learned how to work when I was at Marquette. I learned how to put work into the game of basketball. Two years there, I thought I was working up until I got to Marquette, and that's when I really found out how to really work when I step into the gym, learn how to make the days count. I think that rolled over into my professional career, and I know how to put work in when no one's looking, and I think it's definitely beneficial for me to take what I learned in college and implement that into my NBA career, and that's what I did.",
"I just put the work in and locked myself in the gym like I used to back in my college days and let the hard work take care of itself. I think my Marquette days definitely taught me how to work, and it will always be a special place for me. I feel like I'm going home. I feel like I'm playing a series in one of my hometowns. So, it's a great feeling.",
"Well, I miss them. Great people in Milwaukee. I hold great relationships with a few people in Milwaukee to this day. Like I said, it's a special place to me. I did a lot of stuff within the city. I've been to Brewers games. I've been to Bucks games back when I was in college, and I've been to Green Bay Packers games. So, I was a fan by default, and I did my part when I was in the city of Milwaukee of just embracing the love that I was getting throughout the city and that I get every time I touch the court there in Milwaukee as a professional. It's always love.",
"That place will always be special for me and my family, and the relationships that I share with the people still who live there will always be there. So, it was very special to me.",
"Cam, the one thing that sticks out to me now is that he gets it. His whole mentality, his mindset is he gets it. He gets how to be a pro. He understands it now, now that he was in and out and now is back in, he understands what it takes to be a professional athlete, especially an NBA player. He understands to put the work in. He understands all of that stuff that he went through was a test, and he's answered the bell repeatedly up until this point to get to where he is today.",
"It's no coincidence that he's fought back to be an NBA basketball player playing in the Finals. And what he means to our team, he does a great job of, first of all, talking to and having a relationship with Chris, with him being his backup and him trying to have a great career like Chris. He does a great job of just taking in all the stuff that Chris gives him, all the stuff that I give him, all the stuff that Coach Monty gives him and applies it on the court.",
"We do a good job of helping him, but he does a great job of just applying it. That's all him. That's all him putting the work in and wanting the best for himself and wanting best for our team. He's special to our team, and he's a great weapon to have.",
"I think they started the way I expected them to -- just locked in, locked in on our opponent, locked in on our game plan, leading by example and verbally to our group, reading the defense, just reading the game they're playing. They have done a great job of just being who they are, but at the same time, trying to mold themselves into whatever that series or that team is forcing us to be as a team, as individuals, and I think it's not a surprise to me that they've come out and performed the way they've performed the first few rounds.",
"But it just seemed like right when we needed a stop, they got a layup, they got a three and the lead jumped right back up. Or we had a turnover or what have you.",
"You know, we did a good job of scoring when we had to score and we have to make the game more like two or three or have the lead or when we are down make it one or two possessions as opposed, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. You know what I mean? That's what we have to do.",
"It is definitely frustrating, especially because we're running ourselves -- when we started the second quarter, this is where they hurt us and we come out and do the same thing.",
"We come out and play even with them until about eight, seven minutes and it seems like they make a run.",
"A team like that can hurt you with runs because, like I said, they are so sound defensively.",
"They are going to get stops and they make you pay, whether it is inside with Tim Duncan or tonight with Bruce Bowen with threes.",
You have to keep playing and keep looking to be aggressive.,
"I think you get yourself in trouble when you start becoming passive or start kind of stepping away from, not necessarily the spotlight, but opportunities to take advantage of plays.",
"So, you know, against the Spurs, the opportunities and the looks and things, especially for me, have been kind of few and far between.",
I have had a harder time finding a rhythm. It has been a shot or two here and there.,
I have to try to establish a rhythm myself. I have to keep making sure I am playing the entire game and not just relying on shots to help the team.,
"Yeah, I definitely think that's a big part of it. But I think on top of that, you know, if we're not executing up to par, you know, as far as what we do on the offensive end, then it make it is more difficult for the guys who are kind of in and around Deron, Carlos, Mehmet be effective.",
It is more than a one-guy thing right now in terms of offensively not having enough fire power from enough different spots.,
"And a lot of that goes back to sharpening up our execution so that when other guys do get shots, they are good shots and you can step into them and knock them down with confidence.",
"Yeah, he hasn't really had to hammer it home much, I don't think. That is what his job is and we respect it, we understand it.",
"But it is no secret. I have said it both nights after the game. I mean, to let a team as good as the Spurs shoot in the mid 50s from the field, on their home court especially, you are going to have a tough time winning.",
"So, you know, our chances to win Saturday and win this series are going to be built on our defensive play.",
"That's how it was in the first two series, and it will be no different in this series or any team going forward.",
Defense wins championships and we are playing against a team that has been there before.,
"We have to get that understanding ourselves, no matter how many times the ball is going in and out of the hole offensively, defensively is where you get it done.",
"That's why they are the best basketball players in the world. I think it is not really that, I think it is more so collectively as a team making it hard for them to operate in the space they are operating in, the way they are doing us.",
