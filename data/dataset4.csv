"Yeah, honestly, exactly that. It's impressive to watch him just turn it to another gear in these big games. Honestly, he can shoot it better. He's faster. He's more athletic. He's not getting tired. I just don't understand. But it's impressive to watch from the outside looking in.",
"Obviously a lot of Laker fans in there but to be honest, Vegas is a city where they cheer for just good sports, I feel like. A lot of teams visit here throughout the years and they have built a reputation of just a fan base. Even the Pelicans, they have a good buzz, too.",
" I think all those players in that -- back in that time would appreciate it. Obviously, the evolution of the game has forced a lot of money to be at stake, so you know, getting an opportunity to pay for your summer in winnings, pay for your All-Star break, so you could even pay for the next two summers with this amount of money that's at stake",
"I think it's huge. I think it's huge. Like Bron said, for Adam to be able to put the situation in the season like that and not lose a step, is good for the game. And obviously any city that's playing in Play-In games, you can be in Detroit or wherever, those fans are going to come out. So, I think it's huge for the game. It's huge for the fans in those cities that may not ever get a playoff -- may not ever be able to see the playoffs, so I think it's huge.",
"I think it's a big deal just to be part of the legacy. I think that would make my legacy a little underrated for the outside looking in. But for my family, my fans, my friends, they know what I've been through here and they know who I've crossed paths with, and to be able to stand next to LeBron and AD and guys like that and win a championship, I don't know if it will go unnoticed to a lot of people but for me it will be a huge deal. I could officially say that I would be a diehard Laker fan at that point, right. It's a big deal.",
"I mean, I couldn't imagine their perspective, getting drafted, coming to the Lakers, playing next to the guys you're playing next to, and your first year you get an opportunity to participate in the In-Season Tournament and get some extra coins in your pocket.",
"Yeah, I mean, any time your best player sacrifices his body, takes three charges in the first half, especially with Zion coming down the paint, it sets a tone. That shows to everybody else how locked in he is to win this, and how locked in he is every game.",
"He just looks healthy. He looks fresh. Spirits is great. He's never in a bad mood. Always smiling. Joking. Laughing. Just being LeBron. And like I said, when one of your best players, your best player, acts like that, it trickles down to everybody else, and you always have a good vibe going around the locker room.",
"Yeah, we started off the game well and then they had a little, probably four- to five-possession stretch where they tied it or took the lead, and like you said, Bron just being Bron",
" Just the energy. They play with a lot of pace. Tyrese does a hell of a job leading their whole team. The way they play offensively, super fast, a lot of threes. But just the pace that they play with, we are going to have to be on high alert.",
"Yeah, I told D-Lo before the season started that if they are competing in the East, then I think he has a chance to win an MVP at some point just because of the way he plays and the unselfishness that he plays with.

The way he is making his teammates better, it says a lot. Just for the way we played together, it was simple. You knew he was going to play the game the right way, make the right pass. You never had to worry about that with him.

You tip your hat to a guy like that, one for just being so unselfish when you're that talented.",
"Any time you make shots, it feels great. But there's a lot more to basketball than that. I'm sure you all know that. Like you said, I had not shot the ball well the first part of the year for the most part, but like I said, there's a lot more to the game than percentages and stats. For me, it's just play the game the right way. But obviously it feels good when you see shots go in.",
I agree. I agree with what coach said.,
Just competing. We weren't us. We weren't competing tonight.,
"I got to be better. I got to be more aggressive finding my shot. I got to do more things to get my team going. I think I was too laid back tonight. Just, I can't do that. Defensively, I got to be better.",
" I haven't played in the Playoffs, but from what I've seen so far, I think it's a good, I think it was a good test.",
"We weren't competing. Every time they got a rebound, they pushed it in transition. Whether we scored or missed, they got out in transition, and they played great offense.",
I just got to be more aggressive. I got to be smarter on defense. I think a lot of times I'm over thinking it and I shouldn't be doing that out there.,
" I'll be trying to get my teammates involved, but with situations like that, I got to be more aggressive, it's just as simple as that, I just got to be more aggressive.",
" Absolutely. Like I said, I got to be more aggressive. He was aggressive. His teammates saw that and the energy carried over. So, I got to just be more aggressive and get off to better starts in games.",
"Just looking to score. I have a problem where I literally just try to hunt the best shot possible every time, but my teammates, they expect more from me, I expect more from myself, and I got to just trust my game. I just got to be more aggressive. I think if I'm more aggressive, then that energy will definitely carry over.",
I think this is great. It's great for the NBA. Great for all the teams here. It's just a big deal. I think it's the evolution of the game and it's successful as of now.,
"Every single shot we take offensively, miss or make, they are going to be running the ball down the floor after that right as fast as they can. It's just playing with energy and playing the right way.",
"We extended that lead, and he just does what he does. Gave us an opportunity to be up a handful at halftime. Then coming out in the second half and just putting our foot down and just trying to make it not a game, and that's what we did. We shot the ball really well tonight. We look to improve and build on this.",
"Like I said, for me, it's changing my summer, my All-Star Break. It's doing all that for me just from the games we've participated in so far. I can imagine winning it, what it will do for my family and the people around me, as well, so I can't imagine for them.",
"I think we obviously do it for them. It's not something we speak on, but we know how big of a deal it is to everybody to be able to leave with that, and that amount of money could change your whole, I don't know, whatever you want to say.",
"So, what he said was right. He's a genius for sure.",
"I think it's a big deal, too. I think a lot of teams over sports will try to incorporate something like this just to kind of widen the variety of viewers, raising the level of regular-season viewers and things of all that.",
"
Anybody, I don't know, I couldn't even name anybody. I just think players back then, the pay was different, so to have the opportunity to make a little more money in this environment, I think it will raise the level of play up for sure.",
"It was tough. You know, obviously I had to do my best to get back. I had to do my best to get back. Listen to my medical staff. I did the right treatment. Took care of my body and supported my teammates, and now I'm back.",
"It's okay. You know, obviously not trying to make it about me, but felt great. You know, the medical staff cleared me to play, and you know, out there I had my balance. Thought my knee was stable. Did not feel pain. So I felt good.",
I know what you're talking about. I felt good.,
"24. 24. You know, from my treatment to lifting and getting on the court, pool sessions, keeping my foot elevated, like 24 hours a day. And obviously it wasn't easy but I was willing to do it, and the medical staff had a great program for me that I was able to do what I had to do to stay in shape and at the same time recover and not have a lot of swelling in my knee.",
"And you know, obviously declared me to play. I felt good. My knee, definitely no pain. The swelling was down. I was like, okay, good to go.",
Why?,
No.,
"No, I'm trying my best to not make it about my knee but I'm going to say one more time that my knee felt good. Obviously when you go and play a game, you never know what's going to happen. The play with Jae Crowder, it might happen or the same play that happened; you don't know what's going to happen.",
"I'm just happy I'm out there and I'm able to help my teammates in any way possible and participate in the NBA Finals, in my first NBA Finals.",
"So, I just try to put my attention on that and not, you know, if my knee hurts, if I feel -- you know, at the end of the day, I'm out there. I felt good. I don't feel pain. I can run. I can jump. I can set screens. I can rebound the ball. I can do stuff.",
"So, I'm good. I'm happy. I'm happy that I'm out there, and you know, at the end of the day, I haven't watched the clip, but when the play happened, I thought I'm going to be out for a year, you know. I'm just happy that two games later, I'm back.",
"No, it hasn't come to an end, and I think it's something that's going to follow me for the rest of my career. So, I've just got to embrace it and have fun with it.",
"But at the end of the day I'm just focusing on my routine, my technique, my body, and as I said, it's not going to stop, so I just have to learn to live with it.",
"Of course, 20,000 people yelling, ""one, two, three, four,"" you notice that.",
"But as I said, like I've learned to embrace it. Like I know it's not going to stop. You know, at the end of the day when it keeps going, like it fades away. You know, there's times that the first free throw I hear it but the fifth one, sixth one, I'm not hearing no more and I'm just focusing on what I've got to do and my routine.",
"It was big. You know, obviously, I would have loved to be out there with them, but you know, they held it down, they played great basketball. They played together. They competed hard defensively. I was extremely happy for them.",
"No. I'm participating right now, so that's in the past. You know, everything happens for a reason in life. God always puts you in the position you're supposed to be put in and that's what I believe.",
"So, I'm just happy, man. I went down, I thought I'm going to be out for the year. I thought I'm gone. I thought I'd turn -- I'd hurt everything in my knee. Just being able to be on the bench and not be on a cold table getting surgery and supporting those guys, watching the game and walking around and sharing with them.",
"Obviously, my competitive side will want to play, but at the end of the day you've always got to find the positive things in everything that you go through in order for to you move forward.",
"You know, I'm happy that they were able to get the job done. They played great. They played together. I was extremely proud for the team and I'm happy that I have the opportunity to be out there with them again and finish what we started.",
"For sure. Hopefully -- I can't predict the future. Hopefully I feel better and as we move forward I feel better, and as a team we can get one out of Phoenix.",
"But as I said, I can't predict the future. I might wake up tomorrow and my knee might be swelled up. Hopefully I wake up tomorrow and I'm good; hopefully I wake up two days from now and I'm good, and hopefully we can go out there and compete.",
" I probably say until the next day, I couldn't walk probably, and my knee was like double the size. Usually I never swell up. But you know, I woke up the next day, did whatever it's called, MRI or X-ray, I don't know what it's called and they said I'm good. And I was like, ""Thank God.""",
"But at the end of the day, it's like all the medical staff and the strength and conditioning team, they have done a great job throughout the year to like keep me healthy, and all the work we've put in, that's why it wasn't as bad, you know, because of all the work I've put in throughout the years, I'm happy.",
"Yeah, I'm not trying to make it about me, and hopefully in Game 2, I'll feel better.",
"It felt good. It felt good. Just wearing the jacket and seeing the Finals logo on the jacket and the jersey; obviously, we didn't get the win, but it's good to be here. It's good to enjoy the moment, enjoy the games. You can never take things like this for granted and just try to make the best out of it. But I'm happy that we're able to be here. We worked hard all year to have an opportunity to win a championship, and we're going to keep working hard day-by-day and put ourselves in a position to win.",
"I haven't watched the tape yet, the clips. Got to sit down and watch the tapes with the coaching staff and see what I can do better, what the team can do better, and we'll see.",
"But right now, I don't know. But I just hope physically I feel better, mentally I feel good, and I try to figure it out.",
"I didn't prove nothing. I feel like I have nothing to prove to anybody. I just try to do my job and try to enjoy the process of playing a basketball game and being in the NBA Finals. I feel like we all are extremely pleased. We have a great team. I've said in the past we work hard all year long to be in this position. Like, we have to like live in the moment and try to take as much as possible from this experience. Because like you can never take moments like this for granted.",
"But yeah, I didn't have to prove nothing to my teammates. My teammates know who I am, what kind of person I am on the court, off the court. You know, try not to let them down. But they know if I'm physically capable to play, I'm going to play. They know if I can help them in any way, they know I'm going to try to help them in any way. They know who I am.",
"But the message to the team is that we are in the NBA Finals and enjoy the experience, and now wasn't able to get Game 1 but we have to focus and get Game 2.",
" Just got to keep making it tough on them, tough as possible. They are going to get a lot of shots to go. Great playmakers. Most of the time, they are going to make the right decision. The ball is going to be in their hands a lot. Just have to make it as tough as possible. Keep them in front. Make them shoot twos, but tough twos. And obviously, we know that's what they want to get to.",
"But at the end of the day, they are great players. Like all you can do is contain them as much as possible. Maybe we have to pick them up full court, I don't know. We've got to go watch the tape and see what we can do better as a team and hopefully we can make adjustments from Game 1 to Game 2 and just make it more tough for them.",
"No. I just try to do my routine. And part of my routine is breathing and catching my breath. But yeah, I'm not saying nothing to nobody. Like, who should I say something to? The referee? Why don't you pass me a second early, like I wanted the ball? That's not who I am. That's not me. I focus on what I've got to do. I focus on myself. I focus on the task. And if he gives me the ball one second earlier, I've just got to adjust and find a solution, how can I make the free throw. That's pretty much it.",
"You know, try not to focus on the past much. Trying to learn from it and keep moving forward. But at the end of the day, we were up 2-0 with Toronto and we didn't win the series -- yeah, we were up two.",
"But at the end of the day in order for you to keep getting better, you have to face some adversity. In the previous series, we were up 2-0 with Miami and were able to close out the series and we were down 2-0 and we were able to come back and then we lost the first game against Atlanta and we were able to find a way. We just have to keep finding a way. At the end of the day we take it one day at a time, one game at a time, you know, day at a time, possession at a time, game at a time and just try to figure out ways to put ourselves in a position to win.",
"But try not to focus on the past as much because it's in the past. I learn from it. Hopefully from the series up 2-0, and when the team is up 2-0, we can close out the series and advance to the next round. But at the end of the day, you don't know what you're going to expect. You cannot predict the future. But in any situation we are in, we've got to find a way to win the game, win the game and find a solution to be better, play better and do it together, yeah.",
Yeah.,
"Book got on him. I didn't really care. I was just happy how we all performed, to be honest.",
"Really just approaching the game the right way. Always being alert, little things that matter in long stretches of the game, knowing my matchup tendencies and just being a presence on both ends of the floor. Just putting pressure on the rim and also protecting the rim.",
"I'm just happy because I woke up saying this is just one game closer. I get goose bumps, sometimes I overwhelm myself on the way to the game. I'm having a lot of fun because my guys in there they keep me level and they keep me intent with it.",
"Really when CP and Book started getting to their spots out of our pick-and-rolls early. Me setting good screens and just adapting to how the Bucks was throwing defense at us, whether they were switching or going over or under, just really trying to get a good hit on them and they got the rest.",
"I mean, them dudes is big dudes, man. That's how they really get their offense going especially. Just try to clean up some of that stuff so we can get on a run and give ourselves some momentum as well, and I tried my best. Like Jae Crowder and T-Craig, coming in there just getting some tips or boxing out guys like P.J. Tucker, to not really strapping up my hand when I get the board.",
"It's just the respect level. Like you say, we all got on each other, had candid conversations where we had to adjust. But candid conversations leads to wins, and it started to be great communication and constructive criticism and we just all take it into a positive and play together. Bring it to the other guys, and they see how we are playing as unit and it's contagious. That's about it.",
"Me, I really just take three deep breaths. Close my eyes and after I do that, the whole arena is really empty, to be honest. I just see me teammates and my coaches. There's a task at hand after that.",
"Space out. Coach talks about it all the time, our spacing. We have to punish teams for switching 1 through 5 like that. Like I just heard Chris say, we prepare for any type of defense and we watch a lot of basketball, and where we have been most successful in that situation is space out. So every time he shoots it, we think it's going in.",
"Honestly, I had no idea, but we did prepare for both. I kind of took our energy away from worrying about that and just locking in on what we have to do as a team, because I've said it before, we focus on ourselves more than anything. But obviously he's a big factor to the game, and that can be a whole entirely different game and just scouting. Not saying they're better one way or the other, but we had two different game plans as if he was playing or he wasn't.",
"Just team defense. Communication through everybody. We don't want to make it a make-or-miss game. We want to make teams miss and we want to guard at the highest level. So that's where we have been successful, just banking on that. I think that Clipper game, when it was 71-70 for six minutes straight, we're not making a bucket but we're not letting them score either.",
"So that's where we hang our hats on, our defense, and saying we'll make it work on the other end.",
"Just like Chris whispered to me as he was walking out, he was like, we have been on his ass. And we have. That's why Chris can say that's who he's most proud of, and I feel the same way, because sometimes you walk around the court -- Chris will be talking to him, and I'll be waiting right there, you done, Chris? All right, let me go tell him something.",
"So we're all in his ear. We're all on him. And for him to retain all that information and come perform at the level that he's been performing, it's hard to put words to it. Because we have been tough on him. And he has gone through his phases in his NBA career, but since this playoffs has started you've seen his maturity and his growth grow to a whole 'nother level, and he's continuing to get better. His willingness to learn now, instead of me coming up to him, he might come to me and be like, so what should I do when this happens. So just little things like that. And he still has even more in the tank that he's going to show soon.",
"Tonight it was tough. When we had practice, when we walked in they have the Finals displayed on every TV. It kind of hit me. But it's kind of hard to reflect on what's going on when we're in it.",
"Yeah, we always want to be the initiator of the game and start it off the right way and put pressure on the paint. We put pressure on the rim like that, it opens up other opportunities for people. Everybody on the floor can shoot and can space, so we know when we get downhill that we can make something happen for the team, whether it's score the ball or swing it to the opposite side and get an open shot.",
"Just what you said, just asserting ourselves into the game early. I think the games that we have struggled this year, we were fighting uphill the whole game and starting off down 15, 20 points. But I think when we come out with that pace and that energy, how it should be for a Finals game, we're going to leave ourselves in pretty good shape.",
"It gives you all the confidence in the world. Like I said, we hang our hat on the defensive end, and anything that we're getting offensively is a plus. That's how we try to look at things on this team. So just guarding, and when we can give it to Chris like that and let him isolate any team that is trying to switch 1 through 5, we're in good shape",
"Yeah, he had the toughest assignment tonight in guarding Khris, especially the way Khris had it rolling. But we have been stressing to him all the time, just make it hard on him. He's going to make tough shots, but just always be in the right place. And when's out in transition playing with his length and his speed, he's a tough cover. So if guys want to sleep on him, or whatever you want to call it, he can make you pay. Teams are going to understand that's not the guy to leave open or that's not the guy to leave in transition, because he will make you pay.",
"I just get really excited. That's pretty much it. Us as a team and trusting everybody in this locker room, from coaching staff to training staff all the way down to the players, it's kind of hard to get butterflies because you understand your brother has your back. It takes a lot of pressure off you when you know, good or bad, that you're going to be in the game and you're going to be competing to win. So for me that relieves a lot. I'm sure all the other guys feel that, that you're not pressured to go out there and play a perfect game. You can go out there and play your game, whether you're making or missing shots -- I keep saying it, we're going to be on the other end defending.",
"Chris Paul, he's been a bucket, man. I mean, he obviously, gets his team involved. He's the greatest leader to play this game. But he's been a bucket for a very long time. And my six years of playing against him, or five years of playing against him, you understand that. There's no scouting report that says Chris Paul can't get a bucket.",
"Just the leadership. You understand he's been there before. Our whole team understands he was just there last year, so we bank on him for that grittiness, that toughness. I think a big part of the game was him taking the charge on Giannis down there underneath, just making Giannis think that you just can't go through him every time, because he's a strong base. His shot didn't fall tonight, but as history speaks, we know it will and it can. But he impacts the game in so many different other ways, and whether he's making a shot, whether he's playing good defense, he's always communicating with our team and talking to guys and giving any type of pointers and being honest with them. I always talk about honesty with our team and when somebody's slacking just letting them know. And even if it's aggressive, we have a team that can relay that information and don't take it personal. And Jae is one of them guys that, if you're slipping up, he's going to get on you.",
"Anybody that counted Chris Paul out, I mean we just went down his track record of he's walking in the Hall of Fame first ballot. So you can't ever count any guy out that has done the things that he's done on the court. So if I hear things like that, which I did, I take it as complete nonsense. If he doesn't play another game for us, you can still pay him his contract. His effect is that big, you know what I'm saying? So he moves this team, he leads this team daily. Just having him in the locker room, I'm not even talking about anything he does on the court, he takes the team to that next level.",
"I'm locking that up. That has nothing to do with me. I'm locking C up. I tell him all the time. No, it's tough, it's tough. He's a tough guard. He's one of those guys that you take one thing away, he does the other. It might sound simple, but he just takes what the defense gives him. The ability to shoot the ball and score the ball from any spot on the court just makes you really tough to guard.",
"Just know he's ready. He prepares his whole life for this moment, and it shows out there on the court. Puts in a lot of hard work and sacrifice and takes care of his body. You know he really wants to be here.",
"So just happy to see him go out there, but this is what we -- CP3, man. We know he can do this every game. Happy he did it in Game 1 and helped us get this win. We're going to need him for the next one.",
"Just locking in defensively, getting stops. We all are unselfish and we play fast, so once we get the stop, we just run out and I know for sure if I'm out, they're going to find me. I just start running, even if I'm tired.",
"Just a team effort, getting stops and getting out.",
"Amazing. It just opens up everything, I think. Just for other guys out there, we're spacing and stuff. It opens it up for us to get opportunities. If they start helping toward Book and CP, and then we get shots.",
"For us, just having that mindset to stay ready and be ready at all times because C and Book, they'll find you. That's a great thing about them is that they could go score whenever they want, but they know that they can read defenses and if they're overhelping, they're going to get us looks.",
"No, it's different. It's the NBA Finals. It's a lot different. But I was talking about it earlier today, I think the only thing that I was really ready for was the media. I think being in a Final Four, that media thing is crazy. It's just a lot harder than being on the court.",
"Everything he's doing now, like I said, we knew, we just knew, and when you've been around and played against a bunch of guys, in this fraternity, we all know each other. We all played against each other. We all knew that he was going to be really good. Like he wasn't just good, he was really good.",
"Being his teammate at that time and being the vet on the team, it was my job to make him better. I knew what I had to do for what he was going to see and what was coming and what he needed to be ready for. So I would literally just -- (laughing), it was like that. It was really like that. But he like showed that he was one of the ones. He just like took it, and he just elevated. He became who he is and who he's continuing to be. He's -- yeah. Yeah.",
"Yeah, new place.",
"Yeah, I seen it -- people were talking about it before, but I knew if that came together, that would be strong. It wasn't just that, it was other pieces they were putting together, too. Getting Jae, doing a bunch of little things that they did, they put together a complete team, and they were going to have a chance. They've shown it all year. They've played well all year long.",
"Even their hot start, people were thinking they were going to fall. But they just kept going. You know when you get those two together, if you get the right pieces around them, you're going to have a pretty good team.",
"That is actually really awkward because I do have -- this is like a second home for me. Yeah, people I know and love here, like of course. But no. I'm sorry, no. No.",
"Phoenix is honestly everything to me. Like, I literally turned down my contract I had to go back to Russia, which was the biggest contract I was ever going to sign, and it was a really big decision for me to do that. I wasn't happy about it at first, but my wife and agent talked me into it, and it ended up being the best decision I ever made in my life and it changed my life. So I'm super grateful and indebted to Phoenix and the staff and the people that were here, Robert Sarver, all of them.",
"I still don't know yet, like the whole Finals, it's crazy because every year when you fight to try to get to this moment, and through everything, the injuries, the team, like everything teams go through to regroup and change some pieces and you think you've still got a shot and then you really don't, and then you get traded and you change and now your perspective changes and taking hits and fighting, fighting, fighting, and to actually be here before a game, it's hard to put it in perspective yet.",
I'm super excited. Been working for this moment all my life.,
"I love how that turned into I'm not rooting for the Suns so fast (Laughter). No, no, I'm not talking to many people. This is it. This is the time to lock in and take care of business. I love everybody, but right now -- after this is over, then we can go back to loving each other. This is a battle. This is war. It is what it is.",
"First, for the switching defense, it's always a problem. You're getting a lot of what are presumed to be mismatches on sometimes centers on guards. We've done that pretty much most of the playoffs -- Brooklyn, Atlanta. It's tough. No matter what, at this level, at this point, all the guards are really good. They can all score. Even putting guards on bigs now, it's tough trying to rebound.",
"That's something we carry heavy on our shoulders. Guys know to guard their own, be able to guard to take guys off the glass, being able to help and fight with each other, that's just a part of it. Obviously, it's going to pose that situation a lot of times, but we like our chances. We like our guys out there.",
I forgot what you asked first. Leadership?,
" I don't know. I think Chris is Chris. Like people can -- you can dumb it down. You can say whatever you want about him. Like he's Chris, like Chris is going to be Chris. He's going to be him no matter what. I don't know you dumb somebody like that down. He's just going to be Chris, and I guess that's been good enough to get him where they're at, so I think it works.",
"Man, we just played Atlanta, I don't know how many hours ago. We were home for a nap, and then we got right on the plane to Phoenix. I have no idea what shoes I've got, and I could care less as long as they lace up and I can wear them, that's all I care about. This is probably the first time in my life I could care less what shoes I'm wearing.",
"Wow, that is -- hmm. We were playing at OKC New Year's Eve, and Alvin Gentry just walked in was like, P.J., you start. I was like, What? He goes, you're starting. Mind you, I'm like 15th man for sure, and he's just like, yeah, you're starting. I was like all right (laughing). All right. And I started from then on out. That was my first year, New Year's Eve. I'll never forget that.",
"I don't know. It's like all the cliche stuff, it's easy to say. Don't give up. Keep fighting. But you can say that stuff and still not work out. You guys, it's got to be a little luck, a little of this, a little of that. I don't know. I could sit here and say all that stuff, and it's like all right, whatever.",
"No, honestly, it is that stuff, though. Like I worked my butt off for years and still never got a chance. It never made sense. It never added up being in the right situation, in the wrong situation, until it all just comes together finally, and once it does, you know it. It just happens, and you can kind of keep going from there, but a lot of things had to change too. The game changed a little bit from when I first came in the league. It started to shift, and people started needing different things, and those niches everybody talks about, you started to be able to fill those things.",
"So, a lot of things have to change and have to work in your favor, and it worked for me.",
We tried to prep for this yesterday so we could keep it as normal as possible. We changed a few things up so we could get what we needed in and then allow for media to come in and do what you guys have to do.,
"But as far as us, it was a good day, locked in, focused. We have been waiting to play, so the guys, they're just ready to go. One more drill from me encouraged all kind of looks, but the preparation has been good for us and the focus has been really good.",
