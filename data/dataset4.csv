"Yeah, honestly, exactly that. It's impressive to watch him just turn it to another gear in these big games. Honestly, he can shoot it better. He's faster. He's more athletic. He's not getting tired. I just don't understand. But it's impressive to watch from the outside looking in.",
"Obviously a lot of Laker fans in there but to be honest, Vegas is a city where they cheer for just good sports, I feel like. A lot of teams visit here throughout the years and they have built a reputation of just a fan base. Even the Pelicans, they have a good buzz, too.

I think this is great. It's great for the NBA. Great for all the teams here. It's just a big deal. I think it's the evolution of the game and it's successful as of now.",
" I think all those players in that -- back in that time would appreciate it. Obviously, the evolution of the game has forced a lot of money to be at stake, so you know, getting an opportunity to pay for your summer in winnings, pay for your All-Star break, so you could even pay for the next two summers with this amount of money that's at stake.

Anybody, I don't know, I couldn't even name anybody. I just think players back then, the pay was different, so to have the opportunity to make a little more money in this environment, I think it will raise the level of play up for sure.",
"I think it's huge. I think it's huge. Like Bron said, for Adam to be able to put the situation in the season like that and not lose a step, is good for the game. And obviously any city that's playing in Play-In games, you can be in Detroit or wherever, those fans are going to come out. So, I think it's huge for the game. It's huge for the fans in those cities that may not ever get a playoff -- may not ever be able to see the playoffs, so I think it's huge.

I think it's a big deal, too. I think a lot of teams over sports will try to incorporate something like this just to kind of widen the variety of viewers, raising the level of regular-season viewers and things of all that.

So, what he said was right. He's a genius for sure.",
"I think it's a big deal just to be part of the legacy. I think that would make my legacy a little underrated for the outside looking in. But for my family, my fans, my friends, they know what I've been through here and they know who I've crossed paths with, and to be able to stand next to LeBron and AD and guys like that and win a championship, I don't know if it will go unnoticed to a lot of people but for me it will be a huge deal. I could officially say that I would be a diehard Laker fan at that point, right. It's a big deal.",
"I mean, I couldn't imagine their perspective, getting drafted, coming to the Lakers, playing next to the guys you're playing next to, and your first year you get an opportunity to participate in the In-Season Tournament and get some extra coins in your pocket.

I think we obviously do it for them. It's not something we speak on, but we know how big of a deal it is to everybody to be able to leave with that, and that amount of money could change your whole, I don't know, whatever you want to say.

Like I said, for me, it's changing my summer, my All-Star Break. It's doing all that for me just from the games we've participated in so far. I can imagine winning it, what it will do for my family and the people around me, as well, so I can't imagine for them.",
"Yeah, I mean, any time your best player sacrifices his body, takes three charges in the first half, especially with Zion coming down the paint, it sets a tone. That shows to everybody else how locked in he is to win this, and how locked in he is every game.",
"He just looks healthy. He looks fresh. Spirits is great. He's never in a bad mood. Always smiling. Joking. Laughing. Just being LeBron. And like I said, when one of your best players, your best player, acts like that, it trickles down to everybody else, and you always have a good vibe going around the locker room.",
"Yeah, we started off the game well and then they had a little, probably four- to five-possession stretch where they tied it or took the lead, and like you said, Bron just being Bron.

We extended that lead, and he just does what he does. Gave us an opportunity to be up a handful at halftime. Then coming out in the second half and just putting our foot down and just trying to make it not a game, and that's what we did. We shot the ball really well tonight. We look to improve and build on this.",
" Just the energy. They play with a lot of pace. Tyrese does a hell of a job leading their whole team. The way they play offensively, super fast, a lot of threes. But just the pace that they play with, we are going to have to be on high alert.

Every single shot we take offensively, miss or make, they are going to be running the ball down the floor after that right as fast as they can. It's just playing with energy and playing the right way.",
"Yeah, I told D-Lo before the season started that if they are competing in the East, then I think he has a chance to win an MVP at some point just because of the way he plays and the unselfishness that he plays with.

The way he is making his teammates better, it says a lot. Just for the way we played together, it was simple. You knew he was going to play the game the right way, make the right pass. You never had to worry about that with him.

You tip your hat to a guy like that, one for just being so unselfish when you're that talented.",
"Any time you make shots, it feels great. But there's a lot more to basketball than that. I'm sure you all know that. Like you said, I had not shot the ball well the first part of the year for the most part, but like I said, there's a lot more to the game than percentages and stats. For me, it's just play the game the right way. But obviously it feels good when you see shots go in.",
I agree. I agree with what coach said.,
Just competing. We weren't us. We weren't competing tonight.,
"I got to be better. I got to be more aggressive finding my shot. I got to do more things to get my team going. I think I was too laid back tonight. Just, I can't do that. Defensively, I got to be better.",
" I haven't played in the Playoffs, but from what I've seen so far, I think it's a good, I think it was a good test.",
"We weren't competing. Every time they got a rebound, they pushed it in transition. Whether we scored or missed, they got out in transition, and they played great offense.",
I just got to be more aggressive. I got to be smarter on defense. I think a lot of times I'm over thinking it and I shouldn't be doing that out there.,
" I'll be trying to get my teammates involved, but with situations like that, I got to be more aggressive, it's just as simple as that, I just got to be more aggressive.",
" Absolutely. Like I said, I got to be more aggressive. He was aggressive. His teammates saw that and the energy carried over. So, I got to just be more aggressive and get off to better starts in games.",
"Just looking to score. I have a problem where I literally just try to hunt the best shot possible every time, but my teammates, they expect more from me, I expect more from myself, and I got to just trust my game. I just got to be more aggressive. I think if I'm more aggressive, then that energy will definitely carry over.",
