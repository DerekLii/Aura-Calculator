"Literally for everybody. Mikey, he had three surgeries and still came here and helped us win a championship. Jamal, who had surgery and didn't play well at the beginning of the season, like I told you guys, but we all know what he's capable of.",
"It's good. It's good. We did a job. I think we played the best basketball I'm not going to say in the postseason, but I think we were there playing the best basketball. Today we didn't make shots, but still, we defend.",
"I think it's a great journey. Like you said, 41st pick, but that doesn't matter. When you're here, you're a player. They have a couple guys that weren't even drafted and they're still playing and contributing to them to win.",
"I didn't know that. That's great. But to be honest, I don't think about the next year. I'm going to ask the coach to give me a couple weeks more off so I can be ready for the season.",
"Yes, but we have -- it's not the starting unit. It's the whole team. Since day one in San Diego, it was something different about this team. I felt it. I felt some different energy and every day since then I had the same feeling. I'm not really optimistic guy, but that gave me hope that we can do something.",
"Yes, the core, but if you want to be a success, you need a couple years. You need to be bad, then you need to be good, then when you're good you need to fail, and then when you fail, you're going to figure it out.",
I think experience is something that is not what happened to you. It's what you're going to do with what happened to you.,
"Yes, Jamal was injured. Yes, we lose the first round or second round in the Playoffs. I don't even remember. Who remembers. But there is a process that you need to -- there is steps that you need to fill, and there is no shortcuts. It's a journey, and I'm glad that I'm part of the journey.",
"Well, we have been down big before, we have been down fourth quarters, late in games, and Coach Kerr drew up a couple great sets and me and Steph just got clean looks and you don't want to give us too many of those because they will go in most of the time.",
"I mean, we succeed in our jobs, and we won the whole thing. It's an amazing feeling. But like I said before, it's not everything in the world. I think. Okay, I won it. Okay, not I, we won it. But I think it's not the most important thing in the world still.",
"In that situation, emotions, yes, I yell at them, but I think they're used to it. Sometimes I yell at them, sometimes I cheer them but that's part of the family, part of the team.",
"Everything was hitting. Everything was hitting at once, from the journey, to the celebration with the guys, to enjoying the moment, to looking back on the rehab, to looking back at myself as a kid, as the other viewer, looking from the crowd in or from the camera lens in, and now looking back at them.",
"Every real hooper wants to be on this stage and play in the game and be in this moment. To see it full circle, going from my rehab, not being able to walk, go up the stairs, not just for a month or two. It was for a long time. A lot of different things going through my head. A lot of tears. A lot of blood, sweat and tears, and real ones.",
"Like I said, just to see it full circle and have total belief in myself, have the team have total belief in me, people back home have total belief in me, that's all I could ever ask for, and just to see it like this is amazing.",
"But like I said, that adrenaline kicks in, and you want to do something so bad. That's why I was ready to go at halftime, calm down and reset myself and do whatever the team needs me to do to get the win.",
"I always say, if you go back to the first game in Utah, I picked up the ball in the paint like five times. I could count. I was so lost. I had never felt being that lost on the court before. I just didn't want to go in the paint or jump or land or feel contact. Just how far I've come from that moment.",
"I didn't shoot well early, Jok didn't score early, a couple calls didn't go our way, and Mike, we just told him, this is your night. No matter what happens, this is your night. We tried to make an effort to get him going, and he took advantage of it.",
"I got on him sometime during the season like hey, we're not your little kids anymore. We're grown men, and if we make a mistake just come talk to us. Just come talk to us.",
"Yeah, the best word for me to say is unselfish and having trust in each other. The biggest thing is when we give each other space to work, we allow the defense to make mistakes or our reads to happen.",
"I have to say that I had my doubts, as well. It's just natural. Somebody asked me about butterflies. That's what makes you alive. That's what makes you care. When you doubt yourself, that's what makes you try to find a way to turn it around.",
