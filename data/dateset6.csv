"I mean, a lot of it was kind of myself kind of leading the charge and settling too much. At home in the fourth quarter, I felt like we could go for that dagger punch and didn't really put any pressure on the defense getting to the paint and trying to force the issue that way, and really just kind of settled too much. That's something that is tough to kind of swallow with the opportunity we had in front of us.",
"So win or lose, you appreciate the stage we were on and just that back and forth that we live for.",
"It doesn't matter how good or bad defense I played, he made the shot. So credit to him. He stepped up and took advantage of the moment. It was not a good feeling turning around and seeing it go in.",
"Of course. I didn't play efficient. I had some good moments, but didn't do enough to help my team win, especially down the stretch. I was aggressive, but in the wrong ways settling.",
"I think it's a big deal just to be part of the legacy. I think that would make my legacy a little underrated for the outside looking in. But for my family, my fans, my friends, they know what I've been through here and they know who I've crossed paths with, and to be able to stand next to LeBron and AD and guys like that and win a championship, I don't know if it will go unnoticed to a lot of people but for me it will be a huge deal. I could officially say that I would be a diehard Laker fan at that point, right. It's a big deal.",
It will haunt me for a while because it means a lot to me to try to lead my team and do what I need to do on the court and big stages. Done it before. Didn't do it tonight. It will be good down the stretch or next year coming back and kind of remembering this feeling and being an even better player.,
"There's no room for anecdotes other than we didn't get it done, and I didn't play my best for the majority of the series.",
"It's not a good feeling, like I said. At the end of the day, we want to keep this memory so that it will fuel us as we stay together as a team. Because like Draymond said, this ain't the last time you're going to see us on this stage. Just a tough feeling.

"So hat's off to him. Winning a championship is no easy task, and he was able to accomplish it with his guys. So you congratulate him. If I do see him, that's basically what I'd say. Enjoy. Obviously he's done it before, but enjoy the moment. They definitely deserve it. They played their butts off and got it done.

"Just the energy. They play with a lot of pace. Tyrese does a hell of a job leading their whole team. The way they play offensively, super fast, a lot of threes. But just the pace that they play with, we are going to have to be on high alert.I mean, I don't think there is -- I mean, there isn't any surgery or anything in my future this summer. I need to get healthier, but there is no excuses for what happened on the floor. I was out there, ready to play. I had a some good games; I had some bad games. And that's it. I'll come back stronger next season and be ready to go.",
"We learn from what it was like to win a championship last year, which I think made us the best regular season team in history, and we'll learn from how the playoff run went when we get back here next year.",
"I mean, it doesn't help missing the time, but that was never an excuse for me when I came back from the injury. I've always said if I'm out there playing, hurt or not hurt, it doesn't matter. It's what the results are. And that stays true to till today.",
"I think we've obviously been on the other side of the situation last year, and know how great a feeling that is when you accomplish your goal. I think me and him were kind of just waiting for it to calm down a little bit so we could congratulate the individual guys. Because the competition was amazing in the series, and that's what basketball's all about.",
"But at the end of the day, you congratulate them for accomplishing what they set out to do, and it will be a good image for us over the summer and all next season to remember so that we can come back stronger.",
"I got to be better. I got to be more aggressive finding my shot. I got to do more things to get my team going. I think I was too laid back tonight. Just, I can't do that. Defensively, I got to be better.",
"I don't know. I mean, we had a great regular season. Did something no team's done before. Fell short in the last game of the season. It hurts, man. I mean, that's all I'm really kind of marinating on right now.",
"Just proud of every single guy that stepped foot on the floor for our team this year. It wasn't easy what we accomplished, and it's not an easy pill to swallow what we didn't accomplish.",
Understand that we hopefully will have many more opportunities to fight for championships and be on this stage because it is what it's all about. Proud of every single one of our guys that helped us get here.,
"But there's no denying what he was able to accomplish this series. He played pretty great basketball, made some timely shots. Definitely was a huge reason they got it done.",
